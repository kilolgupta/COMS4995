So I 'm getting rid of my manga .	0
And about half of the stuff in my room .	0
But I 'd like to know what I should do with it .	0
Should I try to get a store to buy it from me ?	0
Sell it on Ebay ?	0
I took a picture of all the manga I 'm giving up .	0
Please , if you could help me out and recommend what I should do ... that would be amazinga cutid1img name='cutid1-end '	0
lol lollol lolgirlyyy	0
haha i know !	0
i 'm such a girly girl.hey have you seen that facebook message i sent you ?	0
You might check EBay , but I kinda doubt you 'll get much for it there .	0
Otherwise ... find a shoujo fan that wants to buy it off of you ?	0
Getting rid of manga is a tricky business , because nowhere around here that I know of buys books .	1
That was a lot of words to say , I dunno .	0
ah well thanks !	0
i will attempt to ebay it .	0
try ebay , otherwise try richer friends .	0
ebay it shall be then !	0
thanks ^_^andlt ; 3	0
To all who think that I have room in the dome at Eclipse .	0
I do n't so make sure you have your own sleeping arrangements such as a tent .	0
it 's my hope not to see any children ... but if i do , i have a few other ways to scare them !	0
! hehehehehe ...	0
well I think there is a childrens area !	0
me ?	0
No , I do n't like you ! KIDDING !	0
Of course you can stay in my tent !	0
sweeeet	0
Cool Cool thanks , I would have been fine with people staying with me but no one asked so there for I have made arrangements with others to stay with me , and I do n't want to be crowded .	0
makes sense captain !	0
tent-owners should be asked , it 's the right thing to do !	1
Also you should be making sure supplies are taken care of before as there is only so much time left	1
Fez and I tryed all weekend with no luck .	0
is there a good time to call you ?	0
I 'm bringing my gigantic tent , and so far it 's just me in there ... if anyone is desperate , and I like them ... : )	0
This is completely unrelated , but I 'd like you to know that whenever I hear Miss You by the Stones , I think of you .	0
*shakes fist* It was just on the radio .	0
Damn you and that song !	0
I am going to steal your kitty and then all of your toys !	0
muwahahahhhathat is all*saRa*	0
i might be weasling in ... my hu-band snores like a motherfucker ! !	1
HAHA !	0
We can make all the snoring guys sleep in the dome , and the ( comparatively ) quiet girls can share the condo !	0
If I wear a skirt I can sneak in with the cute girls , right ?	0
nah man you can come and stay with me .	0
but brin the skirt .	0
can i come too ... watching is fun ! !	0
and this might be funny too !	0
I do n't see why not .	0
But we 'll kick you out if you snore .	0
sleep with your head towards the door , you might scare random children if they walk by the tent and it is open !	1

Sorry , I can always delete the post if you 'd prefer ? I have mostly seen established writers names in the community , definitely , but everyone starts out as unestablished somewhere - some of the best writing has to be the words no-one ever reads .	1
I did n't want this to lie undiscovered by most , it deserves to be read and have each curve of it 's lettering embraced .	1
ah , no need to delete , it was just my modesty flaring up a little there .	0
i 'm fine now .	0
I 'm glad .	0
Someone posted this in a poetry community with a link to your journal , which is how I came to be here .	0
I love your writing and I love your music , and LJ etiquette is a tricky business and mostly I am terrible at navigating it , when I go commenting in someone 's journal I feel like the awkward gangly 13 year old at a school dance .	0
but maybe add each other ? maybe ?	0
i do n't have much time to read here so i 'm awful picky about who i add .	0
however your journal seems like a good thing , so why not .	0
: ) and thankyou , i 'm glad you like my stuff .	0
i was too awkward to even attend the school dances , so do n't feel bad .	1
I 'm the same , I 'm sure ( in fact , certain ) that I 've developed a reputation as some stuck-up internet-bitch because I never add anyone back , I completely understand , and NOW since everyone 's seen that post , you 're going to get eleventy billion people asking you to add them , and I 'm just glad I beat them all to the punch ; ) I 'm Lindsay , and I live on an island at the bottom of the world .	1
new zealand ?	0
i 'm raoul and i live on the west coast of canada .	0
ha , Australia : ) Both an island and a continent ( icontinents are just islands that are harder to leave/i ) .	0
this is so powerful.do you mind if i add you ?	0
i do n't mind .	0
!	0
for you , etc .	0
i think it 's gorgeous as is .	0
love tooth picking up through .	0
do n't forget to send me poems .	0
or anything .	0
troubles @ gmail.com and take care of yourself , boy .	0
do not kill bird , etc .	0
happy birthday , crackpot .	0
mwah	0
a _blankI do hope you do n't mind.I found your journal a while ago , and this little fragment of yours has kept itself in my thoughts since the first time I read it .	0
i 'm glad the fragment stuck in your thoughts , it has been stuck in my head for a while too .	0
i kinda have mixed feelings about being posted in theysaid ... it is a very sweet compliment and i like to reach more readers , but i also feel that theysaid posts mostly established writers , and i 'm not sure if i quite measure up ?	1
anyways , its ok.. if no one has a problem with it , its really nothing to complain about .	0
The first is a parody of the old Hinterland Who 's Who ( Canadian posters will get this one ) It even sounds like the guy who used to narrate them .	0
Now I 'm sure many of you have seen this one ... If you have n't , you should .	1
It 's Justin Timberlake 's `` My Dick in a Box '' Fucking funny .	0

The spider one was fabulous !	0
I am so sharing that with absolutely everyone .	0
The other one , also hilarious .	0
Although , The Husband made me watch it before we left ( one of his co-workers showed it to him ) and I spent the entire Virginia trip turning to him and going `` Wait , what is it again ? ''	0
and watching him flouder , because he was trying not to laugh so that his grandmother would n't get curious .	0
Although , knowing his grandmother , she would have found it hilarious .	0
*hugs* thanks for the morning funnies !	0
`` For more information on the Crack Spiders bitch , please contact the Gov't of Canada '' LOLOL .	0
High humor , I tell ya ! Yeah , that Dick in a Box video 's been around for a while , but it 's still pretty darn funny .	0
I work in a very conservative office , and I was humming that today .	0
One of my co-workers wanted to know what I was humming .	0
I downplayed it by saying `` oh , just a little Justin Timberlake ''	0
Crack Spider !	0
*laughs arse off*Thank you , that made the perfect cap to my evening .	0
I , too , will be sharing it w/ everyone I know : )	0
I KNOW ! ! !	0
I laughed my arse off !	0
Same with the stoned spider who did n't build a web - he built a hammock and lay in the sun all day ... .Glad you enjoyed it ! Rai	0
AAAHAHAHH OMG Dick in a Box is awesome .	0
The steps killed me , `` 1 .	0
Cut a hole in the box .	0
Put your junk in that box .	0
Have her open the box . ''	0
Oh God .	0
I swear there were tears .	0
Ooh I love you for posting this : )	0
AAnd I just watched the Spider one .	0
Yeah , sending that one to *everyone* I know .	0
Thank you : )	0
I remember stumbling across this a couple of weeks ago ... First my jaw fell open , and then I laughed so hard I woke the bird AND the husband ! I think this is seriously one of the funniest things SNL has ever done ! Glad you thought it was as funny as I did .	0
when buying laundry detergent at the store , be sure that its actually detergent , and not fabric softener .	1

i 'm used to a style=width : 50px ; vertical-align : middle ; and a style=width : 50px ; vertical-align : middle ; .	0
i made the mistake when buying it off the shelf , and got two bottles at the time.. and then never really looked at it closely again until i had had bought emmore/em .	0
doh !	0
at least there were no ill effects , other than my clothes being nice and soft : )	0
but did your clothes get clean ?	0

Long story short , our cat was having trouble breathing the other night .	1
It was like she tried to throw up , but could n't , and then she was breathing through her mouth really , really heavily .	0
I was scared for her.If I was still employed at ShopRite , I would have called them , told them I was n't coming in and taking my cat to the vet , and they 'd just have to live without me .	0
But no , new job was not all that sympathetic to my plight .	0
So I made an appointment for later in the afternoon.So before four o'clock I took her in and the very nice vet doctor took some pretty digital x-rays which revealed she had fluid around her lungs .	0
Before 6 o'clock , Brian and I had to go in and say goodbye , because there is no treatment for feline leukemia .	0
She died in human arms .	0
*cries .	0
*That 's so , so sad.I love you .	0
*hugs you tight*	0
[ hugs ] I know what this is like , Simba died of this .	1
I 'm so sorry hon .	0
*hugs* im so sorry hun .	0
that 's what happened to Milo too .	0
that really sucks .	0

*Snuggles and pets* .. I know it hurts , hon .	1
I went through the same thing with Cocoa , my ex-girlfriend 's cat .	0
Yeah , she was n't mine .	0
But ..	0
I lived with her and we enjoyed each other 's company so much she felt like mine .	0
I 'm sorry you had to go through this , and I 'm sorry she did as well .	0
At least , in the end , she knew that people cared and that she was not alone .	0
I do n't really pray , but I 'll give her little kitty soul a few words later before bed .	0
More like Henry Hatsworth and the Best Game Ever !	0

I 'm still not quite sure why you 're comparing two completely dissimilar games .	0
Do you frequently compare Mario to L4D ?	0

back home after the trip to take the inlaws home.the car tossed the serpentine belt in hartford ct.no injuries except the pocketbook and the car.extremely tired .	0

Glad you 're back home , safe and sound ; even if slightly poorer .	0
Rest , dearheart .	0
Speaking as a former FEAD ( Front end accessory Drive ) engineer , the belt was either worn or a pulley gave out .	1
I can think of other reasons but they are less likely.It should not have done much damage to the car , but putting it back on takes some practice .	0
We suspect that it was a combination of things - an oil leak , and old belt .it 's fixable - we stopped right away .	0
*snugs* glad no one was hurt .	0
So I was reminded I never showed you all my new apartment , so i made a silly cribs style video to show it off .	0

Hahah , I miss you.ps - if it were n't for all of this `` magic happening , '' I 'd swear you were on the verge of coming out of the closet .	0

I am such a dork for this but my new FAVORITE show on VH1 is ... ..Scott Baio is 45 and Still Single .	1
This is one of the greatest shows ever made .	0
That is all from my complete dorkiness .	0
We watched that show for about a minute , and we just could n't stand it .	0
They really need to rename it Scott Baio is 45 and a Douchebag , or just Scott Baio is a Douchebag .	1
That would be good.Rock of Love on the other hand is made of win .	0
That is why I love the show ... because he is a complete asshole .	1
It is like a never ending High Fidelity .	0
I on the other hand ca n't stand the ____ of Love shows .	1

I have been feeling very sick in the last year or so , and lately it has gotten worse .	0
I have bad pains in my back and feel tired a lot .	0
I also have been bruising so easily and have a few weird patchy bruises that wont go away .	0
I think I am probably anemic or have leukemia , I fit a lot of the symptoms for both .	1
I not sure I just know something is n't right .	0
I have been getting depressed out of no where some days .	0
I do n't know what to do .	0
I can not go to a doctor , I do not have insurance.Right now I am work in the stock room at Victoria 's Secret and it makes me feel even worse , lifting boxes all the time and climbing around on the latter .	0
I want to try to get a job at Starbucks because they give coverage to all their employees .	1
My job at Victoria 's is n't going well other than that too though , I work with a bunch of rude girls who only have mean things to say .	1
I also get treated badly by my managers .	0
Let 's hope I am okay and it is just stress./font/	0

I am getting a DS for Christmas.I have admitted to myself that I am getting this system almost entirely for Kingdom Hearts.And I have decided I am okay with that.Next : saving up for the newly-cheaper PS3 .	0

Indeed.If I ever get children , I 'll never buy a game console for them .	0
They might end up equally sad .	0
My younger brother does n't have a console , and he 's ten .	0
And I have too many .	0
Other than expensive , gaming is also addicting .	1
Not necessarily in the sense of playing games 24/7 , but you keep buying more consoles .	0
More consoles means you buy more games for them .	0
No kidding .	0

I 'd spend less money that way .	0
Another series would show up anyway .	0

I got a PSP for a reason .	0

I was mildly ashamed of myself when I got the PSP for my birthday , but I 've decided I am not even islightly/i ashamed of getting the DS .	0
XD I got a used one for $ 50 .	0
Really , I ca n't be ashamed of that ; my entire Christmas present is going to cost less than $ 100 .	0
I was also mildly ashamed when I got my PSP .	0
At least my DS could be justified with more awesome games .	0
EXACTLY .	0
D : I can name at least three games I want for the DS.At the time I got the PSP , I only wanted it for Dissidia .	0

For the DS I now have more games , but yeah .	0

one of my goals this summer is to try one new vegetable a week .	0
and also , because i am reading Animal , Vegetable , Miracle i am trying to be more of a locavorethe new veggie this week is napa cabbage .	0
what i did with it was make this recipe for a sort of casserole/stratta ( i made this up , here is the recipe ) bottom layer of casserole dish : ... grated parsnips with nutmug ( maybe about 6 little ones ) middle layer : maple sausage ( brown it first ) top layer : a savory bread pudding/stratta with the green onions and napa cabbage ( 3 or 4 cups crumbled bread , 2 cups whole milk , 1/2 cup butter , 4 eggs , salt , pepper , sauted onions and cabbage..add as much as you want ) bake for 1 hour at 350	0
it was seriously delicious !	1
sweet and savory : ) and every single ingredient in it was local !	0
( except the spices and flour to make the bread )	0
i 'd love to hear about what other ones you try and what you think of them !	0
That sounds tasty !	0
we LOVE napa cabbage up in here and use it in just about everything ... stir fry , rice dishes , baked in the oven covered with garlic , ginger and soy sauce , cooked with ground turkey , tasty raw ( much more than plain cabbage ) so good in a salad ... just some ideas !	0
Sitting in services near Harrow while Bruce gets directions .	0
I 'm a little impatient at the minute because he 's tried to blame me for his failure to take a turn he saw clearly marked .	1
Our first real contretemps of the trip , though .	0

That made me giggle ; it 's so familiar .	1
Mr .	1
Mochi is like Bruce , not much for looking at road signs if they do n't tell him what he thinks they should .	0
So , we 're spending a couple of months in Wales , with Mr. Mochi working at Cardiff Uni .	0
We 'd spent a long weekend in the north and were heading south back to Cardiff by the quickest route , a straight shot down the .	0
He 'd looked at the map before we set out and insisted he knew where he was going .	0
I decided it was n't worth fighting about , so I had a nap .	0
When I woke up , I looked out the window at a road sign and asked him why we were in England .	0
He 's let me navigate ever since.Traveling together is a serious test of a relationship .	0
Considering how big a trip you two just took , and your illness along the way ?	0
Only having one real argument is a huge success .	1
Good for you .	0
Good to hear your voice .	0
I 've been meaning to write , wondering what 's up .	0
Driving unfamiliar roads , on the wrong side , would lead me to forget to look at signs s well .	0
Hurrah for both of you !	0

That 's crossing a line.I can understand not always agreeing with every parenting choice , cuz I mean , come on , there are so many options .	1
But calling your baby ugly and calling you a slut because of things like having fake boobs , oh my fucking god they 're pathetic .	1
they just really all have nothing else better to do , i bet half of those fucks dont even HAVE kids , and they dont know what it 's like to be a parent .	0
Those people are just bored , no life-having idiots who have nothing better than to bitch about someone elses life.. Maybe it makes them feel good to snark on people and bitch about their choice of lifestyle.. it really makes me mad	0
I know , it 's irritating .	0
It 's hard to resist arguing with them , but they 're all so fucking stupid that it does n't even get you anywhere .	0

Oh I know , I found it that one time : D	0
No , but I 'll go on as your lesbian lover while YOU confess that you used to be a man , and then reveal that I 'm okay with that , because I 'm trisexual , and I 'm secretly doing your kitty when you 're not looking .	0

An update !	0
It 's only been ... *cough*four months*cough* .	0
I have n't exactly been gone , but I have been pretty busy .	0
I think Ro described it best in her comment to my last post ... at first it was all about my vacation and I just never have recovered .	0
So basically in the past four months I spent two weeks in Egypt , passed a couple of work milestones , sandwiched in a number of holiday celebrations and asked my new girlfriend to move in with me .	0
*g* All in all I feel quite accomplished .	1
I 'm determined to be a bit less of a fandom slacker , though , so today seemed like a good day for the first new update .	1
I 'll try not to bore you with too many details .	0
*glomps*I was just thinking about you the other day !	0
Are you going to share pictures , at the very least ?	0
Hey !	0
*hugs* I feel like I 've completely lost track of a lot of stuff lately .	0
Hopefully I 'll catch up at some point ! Somebody else was asking me about pictures recently too .	0
I 'll have to see if I ca n't do something about sharing some .	0
It would be nice if you 're able to update this more than once every four months .	0
*gg* Really .	0

when you 're so far away it 's just so fucking hard to imagine yourself into someone 's life .	0
so i never know what to say , so for the sake of not insulting anybody i do n't say anything at all ... i 'm amazed that there are people with journals out there who have n't culled me sooner .	1
i refuse to cull them because they fascinate me , and somehow still put up with my shit on their friends page daily .	1
especially the musicians ... still a bit saddening , though ...	0

b ) I do n't have time to read most of your posts cause I do n't have the net yet at home	1

So ... what 're people doing for Thanksgiving ?	0
We 're visiting dad and marlene for just a little bit , then going to Brian 's family , since his sister 's moving to germany with her husband Then friday we go to NH to visit mom .	1
Oh , and Eryk Brian has to close saturday night but I should be able to come on saturday .	0
The last few years my sisters and I have been up at the crack of dawn to do the Thanksgiving Day Race ... a 10K around the downtown Cinci and NKY area , so we 'll be doing that again .	1
We 've always had dinner at my parents ' house ... so my mom is cooking for a cast of hundreds ( I 'm bring the mashed potatoes this year ! )	1
and my dad will be ( or so I hear ) going down to Atlanta to be with his brother 's family , who usually flies up here for us .	0
oh yeah , you mentioned the race ... that 's so un-thanksgivingish !	0
Being active and junkI 'm trying to think of something to bring to Brian 's family that could be prepared the night before ... but I 'm blanking on anything besides a pie or some such , and I need new baking bowls	0
Yay ! ! !	0
It 's been what , 18 months since we accidentally ran into each other downtown ? Sadly , most of my Tanglewood buddies are travelling this weekend , so there will not be as big of a recruitment session as I had hoped .	0

Having my sister say that my Canterbury kids are lovely people but she does n't know what I 'm doing with them both confirms that I 'm right and not crazy , but also makes me feel a bit sad .	0

Meghan and I have decided to get rid of cable tv because it 's a total time suck , and it 's making us stupid .	0
So , goodbye Rock of Love , ANTM , everything on Animal Planet and the History Channel .	0
I will miss you terribly ( until you come out on DVD ) .	0
yeah , we are considering cutting ours too .	0
maybe in a month or two , once I ease into the idea .	0
Do it !	1
Then I wo n't be the only one left out of the celebrity gossip/tv show discussions .	0
: ) I just know I 'll be so much more productive than I am now .	1
Turning on the tv and spacing out is waaaayyyyy to easy .	0
kudos !	0
good call.i would love to get rid of our cable ... celeste would never go for it though .	0
Maybe you could put the cable box in her room ?	0
Then you would n't have to go in on the cable bill since you 're not watching .	0
yea I do n't know why I pay for cable .	1
almost never watch it .	0
but i do love my project runway .	0
That 's definitely another show I 'll miss .	0
But I figure I can always rent it on DVD .	0
I 'm pretty pleased about how things are going since i 've been back .	1
Working alot and producing pretty pictures .	0
Hanging out with good friends more ... . ( kimmy we need to set a date !	0

That would be cool , im planning on going saturday night , you should go !	0
What mac Counter are you looking to work at .	0
I currently work for Mac .	0
I have worked at three different counters and now I am working at somerset .	0
Mac is not an easy company to get into for some reason or another ... .	0
When I got a promotion to go down to Toledo..	0
I was already hired in as the assistant.. plus the manager and they had one other person hired already before the counter opened ... We had well over 100 apllicants ... We only hired 1 person ... .	0
If you tell me where you want to work maybe I could call around for you .	0
I ca n't promis anything .	0
When you applied did you bring a portfolio and resume.. that sometimes helps ... sometimes does n't .	0
Im looking to work at any mac i can get my hands on !	0
: ) 12 oaks , summerset , fairlane ... i live in garden city , but i will gladly travel an hour to get there !	0
I did bring my portfolio to the one at fairlane mall , and 12 oaks , the one at failane didnt even look , i dont think they were managers , but i did leave a business card that displays photos on it , also i did at 12 oaks , and she loved the portfolio and told me that someone would call me for an `` open call '' but no one ever did : ( so i called summerset to make sure they have my application , but the girl didnt check , just said , well someone should call you for an open call ... so im not sure what to do ... .thanks for the help , its amazing that you are willing to do that ... i just want to work there so bad , and it sucks when it feels so far fetched , im not really sure what steps i need to take next ( in order to work there ) Sorry so long !	0
Thats it !	0
I 've officially missed my flight !	0
In a week and a bits time I get my finger prints taken and then Im on the road to staying here proper !	0
These last few weeks have been hella tough on me ;	1
I 've been dabbling in bouts of depression regarding the games industry and current 3D techniques ; its such a hard job to master !	0
But generally there has n't been much to talk about , thus my lack of posts .	0
I 've been helping Erika alot with her huge amounts of work shes take on , and generally settling in .	0
Im still the ever vigilant house wife , been cleaning up the house really well too ; did you know that the down stairs bathroom had inever been cleaned properly ? /i , well it is now bitch 's !	0
I do have to say , that despite my issues with learning more 3D , I 've been having a hella of a fun time being social , both on the internet and off it .	0
ANd that Portland is LOVELY in the snow ( even if the wind does remind me of the Borro chill .	0
) I 'll try and get back into the posting habbit .	0
Oh man that realllly does n't appeal to me .	0
But thank you for the neato idea =D	0
Speaking of cleaning , I was watching one of my favorite BBC shows today ( How Clean is Your House ? )	0
and happened to see the most horrific flat I 've seen in my life .	0
Be wary as this can make weak stomaches weaker ...	1
Thank god your not dealing with this :  width=425 height=344	0
Oh man I LOVE those ladys .	1
Their so HARSH .	0
I ca n't believe some of the places they visit tho ; Hoarders baffle my mind .	1
I LOVE them too !	0
Perhaps we should have a BBC reality tv afternoon ?	0
ha ...	0
Wow , that was really horrifying .	0
It made me feel better about the state of my apartment .	1
I have a lot of clutter , but it 's all clothes and comic books .	0
Congratulations on missing your flight , Matt !	0
Post more , please .	0
Its shows like this that have turned me into a clean freak !	0
But yeah , you ca n't feel too dirty when there are horrors like that out there .	0
Do it !	0
Post it !	0
Clean it !	0
Rock it ! I 'm sorry to hear that keeping up with technological progression is being especially irritating .	0
It sounds incredibly complicated and scary .	0
Scary enough to compel you to clean the bathroom ! I owe you an email , Sir ! Expect it sometime when I 'm less exhausted and tipsy.Criiiiptic .	0
Bop it !	0
=D Technological progression in the games industry is a wonderful thing , but when you do n't live and breath the job , it becomes hella hard to stay positive and on track .	0
Do n't worry about the e-mail ;	1
I was only dropping you a-line because I figured you were bed ridden and in need of social e-mails =D Get some rest and feel better !	0
Hey Matt , Perhaps you could look into doing 3D for motion graphics - titles for TV News , promos etc .	0
It 's a lot simpler than character animation , but there 's a real knowledge gap with editors and motion-graphics guys .	0
What you might think is straightforward , is pretty advanced for us .	1
Download a couple of tutorials on After Effects and/or Apple Shake and/or Discreet Combustion and start ringing local TV and post-production facilities enquiring about Graphics vacancies .	0
It 's not especially fulfilling work , but might fill the gap until you find something in Games .	0
So , we had to evacuate our town on Monday .	0
I 'm one of the lucky ones who had a place to go that is n't on fire and is not a random shelter .	0
This is just unreal .	0
I 'm pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I do n't have a meltdown .	0
We 're staying with my boyfriend 's parents , hoping the fire does n't reach their town .	0
The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire .	0
I feel so bad for the firefighters - some of them are running on 70 hours straight without sleep , and are dealing with temperatures in the 90 's , not counting the heat from the fires !	1
Fuck !	0
I actually miss going to work - my job is located in another fire location , so who knows when they 'll let us back in .	1
Reading my LJ is the only normalcy in my life right now - so thank you flist and all you LJ sweethearts and fic writers who are helping me not loose my mind - I love and appreciate you beyond the telling of it .	0

this looks fucking disgusting , does anyone have any first or second hand experience with such a hideous invention ? lj-embed id=2 /ll in one makeup .	0
thats right , greasy orange powder that is foundation , concealer , highlighter , eyeshadow , bronzer and lip color all in one .	0
one shade for all skin tones !	0
SPEW .	0
I like how it does n't even look like they are putting the product on their faces .	0
minus when they do the solo shots , the woman putting that stuff on with those little eyeshadow sponge applicators gives me the creeps every time i watch it	0
so , if you decided to use this a foudnation , blush , eyeshadow , and wahtever else they recommend it for ... your entire face will be the same shade of orange , and there will be no definition or contour , IE the POINT of blush eyeshadow ?	0
it 'll just be an even color of orange ?	0
that 's so great i want THAT LOOK FOR ME.you find all the jems .	0
hahhaha i know , it seriously grosses me out , late bday present yeah ? ? ? ? ?	0
? also i love how its like HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF WOMEN HAVE ALREADY MADE THE CHOICE , yeah , hundreds and thousands of women who all happen to be models for stock photosCONVINCING .	0
hahahaha i bet you can use it as mascara and eyeliner too	0
Yeah we have Thin Lizzy here I HATE the informercials !	0
And they have these terrible annoying radio ads for it too .	0
why is it called thin lizzy ?	0
does it make you lose weight as well ? ? ? ?	0
Probably , it seems to do pretty much everything else so why the hell not !	0
thin lizzy is also a body lotion and slimming body bronzer ! i wonder what else you could use it for ... shower gel ?	0

I love the thin lizzy ads.. or should I say THUN LUZZIES ! it amazes me how stupid some women can be .	0
HAHAHAHAHAHA oh man ... There is another brand of this shit , it 's called Thin Lizzy , you might have seen it on late night infomercials or something if you are an infomercial junkie like me .	1
Basically it is the same premise ( I think minus the greasiness and lip-colour claims ) , like a 5-in-1 powder .	0
And yes , first hand experience talking here ... At the Easter Show this year , I was walking through some shed thing waiting for the fashion parade to start , when I was accosted by a brush-wielding lady who proceeded to tell me how horribly pale I was looking , and how I needed colour ( please keep in mind I did have a full face of makeup on ) , and before I knew it she 'd planted me in a chair and started attacking me with her yucky blue brushes .	0
Fast forward 5 minutes and she proudly held the mirror up to my face so I could admire her handiwork.My face was a lovely shade of orange , a shade so flat , so one-dimensional , and so beautiful it really needed to be seen to be believed .	0
I told the lady Oh that 's lovely , I might come back later and then ran far , far away to another makeup stand where they did my makeup in a far less orange manner .	0
I think the word spew sums it up perfectly , to be honest .	1
Yuck .	0
It defies all common sense and is generally shit - sure , if you want to go out looking like you 've dumped your head in a bowl of cheezels then this makeup is your best friend , but really , not my thing .	0
have n't you ever seen those ads for thin lizzy ?	0
Two words : gross , and rip-off .	1
Seriously , all skin tones ?	0
Did anybody else notice how conspicuously tan all the women were in that commercial ?	0
hahahahaha what is wrong with you , why would you let ANYONE at the easter show do your makeup ?	0
its probably makeup meant for farm animalsall in one cosmetic for murray grey cattle more like ithows your skin tone doing these days anyway , you look remarkably tanned in your icon : )	0
Hahahahaha maybe the atmosphere got to me or something , I have no idea what I was thinking , and everything happened so quickly I felt powerless to stop her .	1
Ordinarily I do n't let anyone else near my face with makeup .	0
But hey , if I did n't do all these dumb things , then we 'd have no idea just how laughably bad all this informercial shit really is .	0
At least the experience taught me that I should always always carry my makeup bag with me ...	0
But I wo n't be letting that kind of disaster happen again anyways .	0
My skin tone does look darker now than it did before	1
hey , I think because I do n't have the black hair anymore my skin does n't look so ghostly pale in comparison ?	0
Something like that .	0
And I think the white top in the photo makes my skin look slightly darker in comparison too .	0
Mind you I still get told how white I am , so it 's not like I am really that tanned or anything , I 'm just off-white instead of white-white .	0
Haha .	0
font size=1when they said one shade for all skin tones I do n't think they took into consideration albinosTHOSE RACISTS/font/	1
It helps put a bit of colour on their faces !	0
man , fuck albinos !	0
those guys get all the benefits already , theyre not paying 80 $ every 6 weeks to bleach their hair to a lovely shade off off white , and investing more in shampoos , conditioners and masks to nurse it back to health , FUCK those guys ! all in one albino makeup : talcam powder lolololol	1
$ 40 ? !	0
Plus it makes everyone so ishimmery/i .	0
it 's like magic powder !	0
Mother Nature : pain in the ass , or super-hot MILF ?	0
Neither .	1
She 's just one of those moms who wears the mom jeans while trucking her kids to soccer and ballet .	0
Oh , and she always complains to her husband about how she does n't even know who she is anymore and he spends too much time at the office and is he cheating on her with his secretary .	0
Oh wait , that was me .	0
Heheh ... damn , they should really go into couples ' therapy .	1

take intro to buddhism ! !	0
do it do it ! last semester i took ans 301 ( intro to asian religions ) w/ brereton and tho it has nothing to do w/ any of my mjors i LOVED it .	0
the prof was awesome and the material was really really interesting ( at least to me ) plus politlca philosophy ?	0

They have a long excerpt from Foucault 's Discipline and Punish and they do n't read it .	0
That 's inexcusably criminal .	0
font color= '' ff00cc '' are you minoring in philosophy ? /font	0
if you are in the college of natural sciences , you ca n't minor in anything .	0
you can only get double majors , and no , i 'm not double majoring .	0
i 'm just enjoying philosophy while it counts for a classics/fine arts credit .	0
Actually , an intro to Taoism would be a great match with your quantum physics class , if available .	1
Barring that , I would first go with your instincts based on your knowledge ( direct or by reputation ) of the philosophy professors teaching those classes if you want to choose between the two .	0
Barring a clear choice based on teachers , however , you might want to save Buddhism for a later part of your undergraduate career .	0
Your preference for rationalism will be severely challenged depending on how the professor approaches the subject . ( Good call on dropping one of them , though .	1
Do n't try more than 5 classes at a time , especially if one or more of them is a lab class .	0
You end up working too hard , burning yourself out , and your knowledge level for all classes goes down . )	0
img alt= every day I drive past the murder house and wonder if the new tenants know.and I wonder if the tub was replaced.img	0
I remember reading that the acid didnt work out as well as she would have hoped .	0
she got the idea from being a chemical expert in the army , but apparently the training and expertise didnt delve far enough into body disposal .	0
I cant even imagine what the medical examiner had to face when they showed up .	0
and I also remember that at first I assumed the husband who got killed was the guy she was fighting over .	0
nope ... he just happened to be married to the wrong woman , who was the intended victim .	0
his wife and Ivette were fighting over a totally different guy .	0
so let that be a lesson ... if youre gon na cheat on your husband , do it with a guy who doesnt also have an insane homicidal stalker .	0
ya , I cant believe she did it in the first place , and then that she wandered around with the baby and then confessed !	0
and I havent seen anything on the internet posted since the army took over her prosecution and made her disappear .	0
I figure she is either spending the rest of her life in a dungeon or she 's been dishonorably discharged and released .	1
I wonder if dismembering the bodies into smaller portions would have helped .	0
That and placing each one of the portions into individual containers ( ones that the acid would n't eat through ) as opposed to the victim 's ( ? )	0
bathtub , lol.Moral of the story : Do not piss off crazy people who are fully capable of murder .	0
Uhhhh .	0
so wait , you seriously dont think she 's hot ? I once dated someone who looked a lot like her , and she was probably just about as crazy .	0
she had a real Lifetime movie of the week vibe .	0
I think it is seriously messed up that you think about it .	0
it happened right down the street from me , halfway to my friend 's place , and I see people coming and going there all the time .	0
how am I supposed to just forget it happened ?	0
it would be kind of hard to not wonder if the new tenants know what went on there .	1
up the street in the other direction there 's a house where some hired killer unsuccessfully tried to burn the body of the woman who lived there .	0
that was so long ago I dont even know how many years it 's been , but I remember that pretty well too .	0
I guess I 'm not desensitized enough to just forget about people being murdered in my neighborhood .	1
I think you misunderstand what I am saying .	0
I think it is messed up that you would sexualize a murderer .	0
all of the deeply disturbing , ridiculous , and seemingly incongruent aspects of her life make her irresistible .	0
subject says it all.Only ... .we know 0 choices are left .	0
She probably should have planned ahead and bought that muriatic acid way beforehand ( that and get rid of the receipt ) .	0
But that is assuming they are n't going to trace purchases of that kind of material back that far .	0
I wonder how well that acid bath worked , anyway ?	0
Did they ever say ? Still , it 's her own stupid fault for telling that person HEY !	0
I totally took this baby from a couple I just murdered the fuck out of.She gets an A for effort , either way .	0

You MUST tell me how you get your hair to stay that big all the time !	0
Every time I tease mine , it is flat by the time I get to the club .	0
Boo !	0
You and your impeccable style , hair , face , everything .	0
Hmph !	0
babe pretty much the deciding factor between beauty and beast is the hairspray you use .	0
the most rock solid shit i have found so far is actually reasonably cheap too- its FAT HAIR 0 CALORIES by samy .	0
its in a tall red bottle thats a knock off of BIG SEXY HAIR .	0
basically you just need to look for the most ridiculous named big hair hairspray you can and it more than likely will keep your hair in place all night.also- try teasing twice/thrice on clean hair .	0
if your hair is dirty ( and unteased ) spray some dry shampoo through it first , then try teasing two or three times .	0
i alternate between a tooth comb and a big muhfuggin brush , and mainly tease my roots .	0
spray them with fat hair ( its got a consistency similar to toffee in the way that its fucking sticky when wet but will dry to a crisp ) and then leave it set for a minute or two , electricuted stylez .	0
THEN push your hair down carefully with either a wide toothed brush/comb or even your fingers cause that shit seriously turns your hair into hard candy.then evenly spray your hairstyle all over to set it in place .	0
another trick is your actual haircut .	1
mine is really thinned out ( less weight ) my top layers are pretty short , so they dont have long ends holdin them down .	0
hope that helped ?	0
p.s .	0
big sexy hair gives amazing volume but shit hold , so youre better off with teasing the hell out of your hair and spraying it with some hardcore holding shit .	1

ba growing clerical sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church are proof that the Devil is at work inside the Vatican , according to the Holy See 's chief exorcist./bNo point snarking this , really , is there ?	1
Seems to me , if it 's 1 ) , he 's not serving his cause by going public with it .	0
If it 's 2 ) , well , yeah .	0
I think it 's 2 ) .	0
Either 2 ) , or he 's being quoted out of context .	0
Or maybe it 's 3 ) Dudeman , at 85 , is confronted by the fact that many of the people who serve the same Holy Mother Church , people he knows , quite possibly , people in whom a great deal of trust has been placed , have engaged in a massive , heinous conspiracy .	1
To stave off heart-attack-inducing shock , he pretty much has to find evidence that it was something larger than the people involved , and thus has to turn emhimself/em 'round the bend to live with himself .	0
I could see that .	0
I could see 3 , certainly , but I do n't think there is a massive heinous conspiracy going on .	1
If you get a lot of people performing the same actions to cover up their fuck-ups , it tends to look like a conspiracy .	0
Sort of like cashiers robbing the till ; if you found that such filching was widespread and was covered by individual managers and executives due to personal connections with this or that cashier , you might think there 's a filching conspiracy going on .	0
Really , it 's just people being predictable in covering their ass .	0
However , I tend to plump for simpler explanations .	0
Therefore , my vote is on 2. : )	1
Eh , I tend to put raping children and covering up the rapes on a much higher plane of crime than skimming off the till .	0
Given that police were actively dissuaded from investigating the crimes , criminals were shuffled around to avoid repercussions and make the trail harder to follow , and given it took place in multiple nations , all while higher-ups reassured people that no such thing was happening ... I tend to class it as heinous conspiracy regardless of how coordinated the effort was as a whole .	0
For it to be a conspiracy there has to be a guiding force , a cabal behind the whole thing .	0
There are no real 'ringleaders ' in all of the abuse cases I 've seen , even here in the USA .	0
It 's more a case of 'this priest knows this archbishop/bishop/cardinal and uses his friendship to skate clear ' .	0
To define as a conspiracy , I would need something like the Cabal of Underground Sex Cardinals coordinating the moving of abusive priests to finance their porn industry or similar .	0
Errr ... last I heard , around the news of the Murphy and Ryan reports , there was evidence then-Cardinal Ratzinger sent letters instructing bishops to pass any reports of child abuse to Rome rather than local law enforcement , before he took over his current office as Pope .	0
There 's also been plenty of cases of the bishops in Ireland , e.g. , passing the buck up to their archbishop .	0
Whether it was a conspiracy within the organization as a whole , or dozens of smaller conspiracies around the world , you have to admit that there are coordinated efforts among multiple individuals to aid and abet the criminals who abused children .	0
It 's not a hands-clasped Snidely Whiplash `` I am evil to be evil mwahaha ! ''	0
cartoon villainy ... but it 's coordinated efforts to protect child predators .	0
That it might have been done out of a global sense of CYA does n't make it better or significantly change the nature of the thing .	0
Or otherwise it may be 3 ) - a lifelong plan to troll the Catholic church which he 's finally putting into action .	0
Which would be epic .	0
It 's a ( freakish , medieval ) version of `` mistakes were made '' - it takes responsibility away from any actual person or group .	0
Enh ... given that part of the job of Holy Mother Church is to protect the common man from the influence of the Adversary , saying that he has taken control of leaders of the Church is n't exactly good CYA - particularly from the head of the folks in charge of recognizing and rebuking his manifestations .	1
It 's more the sort of accusation you 'd expect to hear leveled against the Church during the Protestant reformation - `` Satan is at work in the highest ranks of the clergy , and the time has come for good Christians to break away from the corrupt Church . ''	0
Mocking the Catholic church at this stage in history is almost redundant .	0
The Daily Mash did it anyway .	0
.well , depending on how you define `` the Devil '' , I could see it as making sense .	1
I mean , if you think of `` the Devil '' as `` the personification of evil , or as an anthropomorphic conception of evil '' , and sex abuse is evil , and the coverup of evil is evil , and the coverup of the sex abuse came from within the Vatican , then , well , yes , the Devil is at work inside the Vatican .	0
What he said .	0
`` The devil is at work '' may be Churchspeak `` people are doing bad things '' .	0
This implies the mindset that it 's some external force influencing them , that they need to just pray against it or something .	1
Well , it 's not as simple as `` pray against it '' .	0
It 's `` pray against it , search your soul for what you have done and how to change , and take steps to rectify the wrongs and stop doing evil in order to keep the Devil at bay . ''	1
Catholic doctrine does n't allow `` the Devil '' as a `` get out of responsibility free '' card .	0
It carries a different implication when an exorcist says it , though .	0
It 's the emjob/em of these guys to differentiate between `` Man , that dude is an asshole '' and `` this person is emliterally/em being possessed by a fallen angel , and we must cast the demon out ! ''	0
Theoretically they 're emsupposed/em to require a high level of evidence of infernal intervention before involving themselves .	0
It 's possible when the chief exorcist says `` the Devil lodges in the Vatican '' he means that , literally , the Devil is possessing members of the Church .	1
It 's what he emshould/em mean in using that language , given his job .	0
Either way , it 's ludicrously alarmist and a little nuts .	0
No matter what his goal is in saying it , odds are he 's not making much ground toward that goal .	0
iit 's ludicrously alarmist and a little nuts/i Unlike the rest of the Pope 's exorcist 's duties ? span class='ljedittime'emEdited at 2010-03-11 05:46 pm UTC/em/span	0
Well , frankly ?	0
Yes .	1
I do n't believe in their party line , but they do , and this is inconsistent with what the job is supposed to entail , if I remember correctly from Catholic Boot Camp .	0
The job of exorcist is emsupposed/em to be rather like folks involved in canonization - to be skeptical , seek solid evidence , then act - not to see devils everywhere and try to solve every problem with exorcism .	0
It seems counterintuitive , but the Church knows just as well as anyone how ridiculous they would look treating every rebellious teen as possessed , or what have you .	0
The folks they officially grant permission to perform exorcism are supposed to be levelheaded enough to avoid this kind of bad press , while still combating the possessions the Church has to believe occur now and then .	0
The chief of the branch should be even more responsible than the run-of-the-mill exorcist , not less .	0
Reading the article I ( as a Catholic ) have two theories:1 ) Dudeman has actually gotten some proof somewhere that the Vatican has been beset by the Devil.2 ) Dudeman , at age 85 , has a gotten a touch of senile dementia that 's affected him from investigating over 70,000 cases of demonic possession over his career .	0
That senile dementia is now causing him to see shadows where there are none .	0
pAwesome .	1

This is the comment I posted.iI saw it when I was too young to pick out rascist undertones ( or overtones ) , but I remember liking it , but have n't had the oppurtunity since to really form an opinion on it , because so many people hate it.I like the Uncle Remus stories .	0
I do n't see why the animated characters in Song of the South have been wiped out of everything Disney .	0
Were n't they created by African Americans ?	0
Are n't a lot of those stories satirical of white slave owners ?	0
I 've heard the argument that the film sugarcoats slavery , and being a Disney movie I do n't see how it could n't , but I 'm betting Song of the South is much less Rascist than Gone with the Wind , and not nearly as bad as Birth of a Nation , but every film student is forced to watch those pieces of crap at least once./iNow what do you all think ? Long-ass post in an hour from now .	0
Promise .	0
my stepmom picked it up overseas years ago , so i 've sort of grown up with it ( though it 's been at least a good 3 or 4 years since i 've seen it ) .	0
i never really saw it as rascist ; in fact , the implication was of black people outsmarting white people ( in animal form , that is ) .	1
i always found it to be entertaining , and i think it 's really cool that they are considering a rerelease	0
My mom used to have a boat and she called it the Laughing Place , because apparently , there 's a part in that movie where someone says , everyone needs a laughing place .	0
What does this have to do with your comment ?	0
Maybe the word overseas triggered this memory ?	0
Who the hell knows ?	0
Allow me to submit an analogy : Song of the South is to Slavery , as any image of the twin towers is to 9-11.Remove them and pretend the event never happened ... .unless you 're running for re-election .	0
huh ?	0
as a person with a folklore degree , they 're kinda slavery era in that when joel chandler harris collected them they were told him by a black male who was either a neighbor or a servant of the family ( i suddenly ca n't recall which ) .	0
really the stories are variations on african folk tales , existing american folktales ( like jack tales ) and some elements and stories were created so to speak or altered during the slave years , but not all of them .	0
they 're really a mishmash of traditional stories , especially trickster tales and the trickster in every other element of american and really every society is an admired figure who sticks it to the status quo .	0
they 're cautionary tales and fables as well - it 's sad that they 're dismissed so readily by people who 've probably never even read them .	0
they definately do not promote or condone slavery in the least - if anything they 're against it , as the hoovmeister said .	1
all folktales , regardless of when they were created or under what circumstances , are an integral element of our society and to ignore them or media stemming from them is doing a serious disservice to our youth .	0
it saddens me that folklore 's basically dying out between the encroaching technology and political correctness .	0
in terms of the uncle tom-like remus as lucas mentioned , you rarely saw beatings and uprising in folktales - folk songs , yes - folk tales , not so much .	0
so yep , much overblownedness .	0
i have a copy of it on vinyl leftover from my childhood .	0
take that mister establishment ! hey , i have n't cussed this whole time .	0
shame on me .	0
here 're five token expletives : uncle fucker , fucktard , assmonkey , dickhead , and cuntmeister general .	0
The degree in folklore is a cool thing to have.if I was a rapper , I 'd prolly want to be called hoovemeister F.man , I 'm not even keeping a train of thought anymore .	0
Thanks for the info .	0
Song of the South should be released again .	1
It is not racist .	0
Uncle Remus was a slave and the stories came from slavery days .	0
While slavery was a horrible thing , we cant just act like it never happened .	0
Let people see this delightful movie thats full of morality stories and great songs .	0
American culture has a spotted past , the best way to accept it and move on is to embrace it.Basically the folks who want to cry racism and what not are blithering idiots who never managed to open their minds enough to see what this movie was about .	0
robo_rob who has it on bootleg and saw it in the theaters when he was a child .	0
See I knew you were going to say something cool and rational about it .	0
yes , at every point.except , that the stories didnt actually come from the days of slavery .	0
I looked that up and there seems to be no availible information on when the stories first started being told .	0
Popular belief is they started during slavery .	0
However popular belief can be wrong .	0
So *shrug* whenever they came out .	0
sure , it may not matter to much.except that when i author stuff i want credit for my work .	0
as does joel candler harris , their author .	0
Now this is interesting , because I remember us having an argument about whether or not Denis Leary was a thief for stealing Bill Hicks ' material , and whether or not people have ownsership of an idea.Speaking of which , fuck Denis Leary .	0
Fuck him with a copy of Operation : Dumbo Drop .	0
Yeah , I 've got a bootleg as well , and I have to say that this is a movie you get for the animation and ONLY for the animation .	1
For two reasons : the animation is some of the best done character animation that exists and because the live action elements are VERY badly written , acted and directed .	0
Not bad as in imoral , but bad as in just poor quality .	0
It 's not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon .	0
The most labor any black person does is cooking , there 's no bloody uprising , nobody is beaten , bought or sold .	0
Remus does get a browbeating from the mother and grandmother for telling stories to the kid , and he does get very no mam , yessum humble and even depressed about it , but that 's as bad as things get .	0
I do n't think this movie was shelved so much because of it 's being offensive as much as it just being embarassingly badly done .	1
I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it was n't hugely financially or critically successful and really did n't quite fit next to other live actionnimation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves .	0
So yeah , my basic thoughts ?	0
It 's not a great film , the worries about racism are far overblown , the kid 's a demon , the animation is beautiful .	0
Rerelease it ?	0
Sure , it should be made available to people who want to be able to buy and watch it , but it 's not something that will make a ton of cash on DVD or have more than a very small niche market .	0
Great animation , but crappy live action ?	0
Gee , sounds like a Ralph Bakshi movie .	0
I miss that guy .	0
Christmas in the Park is touristy cheesiness at it 's finest .	1

We are trying to catch up on Survivor before watching this current season of Heroes vs Villains to really appreciate who all these people are .	0
Unfortunately , I had only seen 14-19 and Matt had only seasons 18 and 19 .	0
So far we 've watched Seasons 1 , 2 and 7 .	0
Season 7 was amazing !	1
There are so many great people with intense ( good and bad ) personalities , crazy challenges , big surprises and bit 's all pirate themed/b.We also bought seasons 8 , 9 and 10 .	0
We can get seasons 11-now on itunes .	0
But what about seasons 3-6 ?	0
I can find them online for free but the quality is TERRIBLE !	0
Anyone know where I can get seasons 3-6 that is n't a choppy , garbley mess with a giant logo slapped over a huge part of it ?	0
Have you tried hulu.com ?	0
Normally they have everything on there .	0
Me and my boyfriend are currently going through Stargate SG-1 on there .	0
Yep , checked there right after checking the main survivor site on cbs .	0
It looks like Hulu 's policy seems to be to only offer what is currently being offered by who has that copyright .	0
I 've noticed that with other shows too .	0
When you could get all 4 recent seasons of survivor on the main site there were all on hulu .	0
now both hulu and the main site only have clips and bits of the last 2 seasons .	0
I 've never seen either of those shows , but I 've heard of survivor .	0
Your post made me remember a Madtv parody skit of it .	0
I find it hilarious .	0

Completly randomly , I have decided that I hate gay men *nods distraughtly* .	0
EVERY guy that I even slightly like is gay = ( It should n't be allowed .	0
I 'd kill to be their boyfriend *sulks* .	0
I do n't like straight girls very much at the minute either .	0
Yup , you got it , I 'm so lonely !	0
Not in the I'm-horny-and-need-sex-now sense ... just the general wanting a partner that is like your best friend and knows you better than anyone blah blah fairytale sense .	0
I think I vaguely remember that once upon a time .	0
Gah , I 'm being mushy on you all now .	0
It wo n't happen again .	0
Promise ! But while I 'm at it , I may as well add guys with girlfriends and even girls with girlfriends to my hate list .	0
*jealous*	0
All the great men are either taken or gay .	0
Sad truth of life , my dear ... The best male friends I 've ever had were gay .	1
You know they do n't constantly think about getting into your pants .	0
But sometimes , I 've got to agree , gay men are a big disappointment .	0
; ) Same thing with straight girls .	1
Or those who claim they are straight , but play mind games with you ?	0
Oh darling , I 've been there , more than once .	0
My first girl 'crush ' ( I hate that word though ) was this girl who I have been friends with for a couple of years .	0
So yeah , for about a year , she was playing mind games with me , which ended up in me getting super confused .	0
Her feelings about me have never ever been clear .	0
I never knew if she was just joking around , or whatever .	0
Also , she 's been with this guy for like , 5 years , so I dunno .	0
Maybe it was -his- fantasy ?	0
His girlfriend making out with another female ?	0
Or maybe she really is genuine ?	0
Whatever , it 's all too confusing .	0
I 'm terrified of talking to her about this , and plus I have n't seen her in months - wait , over a year !	0
: ' ( It 's pretty hopeless ... And I 'm blabling .	1
'All the great men are either taken or gay .	0
Sad truth of life , my dear ... 'Profound truth = ( 'those who claim they are straight , but play mind games with you ?	0
'Been there , experienced that .	0
That has got to be one of the cruelest things that a straight person can do to someone gay/bi .	1
As if it is n't difficult enough to start a relationship with someone of the same sex , all that teasing and leading you on confuses the hell out of you .	0
If you have n't seen that girl for so long , then I can see why it looks hopeless .	0
I doubt it was her boyfriends fantasy ... more her own- you know like one of those teenage experiments that everyone seems to have to have whether they are certain about their sexuality or not .	1
It was nasty of her to be a complete head-fuck though *huggles*And do n't worry blab away , I do it enough =P	0
You are the sweetest .	0
Seriously .	0
: ) I doubt it was her boyfriends fantasy ... more her own- you know like one of those teenage experiments that everyone seems to have to have whether they are certain about their sexuality or not.Yeah , that was probably it .	0
Heck , it 's almost insulting .	0
She was a Gemini , just like me , so I think that 's why our 'relationship ' ( if you call that one ) was so awkward and weird .	1
Hah .	0
Two double-signs do n't match , it seems .	0
We even had the same birthday ( just not the same year of birth ) !	0
I should 've known it was impossible .	0
Ah well .	0
Live and learn , they say .	0
I 'm gon na take this advice.That has got to be one of the cruelest things that a straight person can do to someone gay/bi .	0
As if it is n't difficult enough to start a relationship with someone of the same sex , all that teasing and leading you on confuses the hell out of you.The mind-fuck part is terribly painful .	0
: ( Playing with people 's heads like that should be outlawed .	1
I feel like I 've been used , and that 's just gross .	0
I will probably never know if she really loved me .	0
Actually , the more I think about it , the more I 'm convinced she never did .	0
And you 're so right , starting a relationship with someone of the same sex is really difficult and complicated .	0
Even with the opposite sex , hah .	0
I have no relationship skills whatsoever ! Pseudo-bi girls piss me off .	0
Haha .	0
They really do .	0
*hugs*	0
You use astronomy ?	0
I 'm not into the whole horoscop things you get everywhere- I doubt half of them are real lol but I do like the proper idea of it .	0
Mine is quite interesting because my sun sign is Libra and my moon sign is Scorpio .	1
That makes some weird combinations XDI 'm really sorry about what that girl did to you = ( I had an ex that was a complete head-fuck so I can totally emphasise .	1
Pseudo-bi girls are the reason I was uncomfortable with my sexuality for a while .	1

You run to him right ?	0
Or in my case ... you ride .	0
I 'm a silly girl sometimes .	0
: ) I had a pretty horrendous ride in this morning .	0
I left Chapel Hill at 7 and got to work in Spring Hill at 7:40 .	0
I stalled 5 times ( my chain needs greasing ... grr.. and i keep flooding her at the lights ) ... and sat in bumper to bumper traffic on the Western Motorway , going not much faster than an average 40km/h.In QLD bike riders go up the inside or the middle ... but I thought `` no , I 'm a terrible rider , I need to practice my slow ride '' ... and thank god for that , there was a cop car sitting at the end of the motorway , who 'd nabbed 2 riders.I 'm so tired now and i 've a headcold as well .	0
Oh I was n't woken up , I was very awake .	0
And yeah that time is correct..	0
I remember it was MIDNIGHT I actually went to sleep whereas when you came I was at the computer .	0
Ahhh !	0
Cool .	0
Glad I did n't wake you up ! I did think it was strange everyone was asleep .	0
I felt bad getting Ian out of bed ... but it was his request.But your car had a girly pal for the night , harriet was all tucked in next to him awwww	0
CRX is a whore , get Harriet checked asap.I also need to move him down to the bottom car space so Ena can use the park next to the entrance.Yeah for some reason we all slept really early last night .	0
Or at least retreated to our rooms and switched lights .	0
If you did wake me up it 'd be a case of `` whaa..oh..snore '' : )	0
well I did find her covered in moisture this morning : PBut I think that was the dew ! Meh , I think it 's just as easy for him .	0
Makes sense to have the small car at the top where people walk past .	0
Besides that , it might encourage you to drive him more ; ) I know at least 4 people that would be happy to go for drives with ya ! It was indeed one of those nights for me too ... until I was summoned !	0
If i ever catch u riding in between lanes i will personally come to Brissie and brain you girl.Did your defensive riding teach you nothing ?	0
Getting to work ... what ... 5 mins earlier max ... is worth risking your life ? Gee- u love your job .	0
Believe me , that 's exactly what was going through my head !	0
The words of my defensive driving instructor !	0
! I was envious of them , but I would never be that stupid go between the traffic .	0
ESPECIALLY on a motorway .	0
It 's still true though , the cops turn a blind eye -- they even said that in my course.It was the shoulder verge that I was jealous of , but that IS illegal ; )	0
I know honey , i was the same ... . i would sit wishing i could be as stupid as the rest but then i would see someone nearly get hit and decide i was glad i had a brain ; - ) Most cops will turn a blind eye but they will sometimes crack down on it too .	0
I think its legal in Victoria to ride between lanes ( or used to be ) but hadnt been legal in sydney - with good reason.I nearly lost a friend at 19 to a motorbike accident , she was in a coma for 18 months - because she and a car both ran the orange .	0
Neither of them won .	0
yeah : ( its those stupid idiots that give bike riders a bad rep too ! They 're making it harder to get a licence up here now too .	0
Apparently scooters/bike riders are on the increase for causing accidents.Ahh those kind of stories scare me ! !	0
But 's the reality of it all .	0
it 's legal to ride in between lanes of stopped traffic in Sydney ... just not moving traffic.the pre-provisional instructor told me that one , so I feel it 's on fairly good authority ... .	0
also , I think scooter/bike riders are just on the increase .	0
the more there are around , the more there are to increase accidents.I do n't think the percentage of dangerous riders is actually increasing ...	0
i ca n't believe cops would nab you for doing thatwellat least not in standstill traffic .	0
maybe in 40kph traffic it 's a little nuts : Dgo lara for not being insane : D	0
Its illegal because its an incredibly stupid thing to do .	1
Its too easy for some dimwitted motorist to decide to `` jump= '' lanes '' and pull out without looking , or open a door or what the hell ever that might cause you to have an accident .	0
Only idiots ride in between lanes./end rant from motorcyclist with a brain ... . and alive after 13 years of riding in sydney traffic : Pspan class='ljedittime'emEdited at 2008-03-05 02:27 am UTC/em/span	0
hmmmtruewhat about on the road shoulder ?	0
Again , idiots can pull out or swerve over fast if they need to .	0
Shoulder is for emergency vehicles and breakdowns .	0
Do you wan na be the accident the ambulance needs the lane access for ? People do it , i just think they are silly doing so .	0
I value my life more than getting somewhere 5 mins faster ... . and really thats the most u would make from lane swapping and riding between them etc .	0
You dont make up as much time as you would think once you do the calculations .	0
well yeahi 'm not a rider , but when i 'm driving i do n't weave .	0
It just requires so much more concentration then sitting there cruising with trafficnot to mention the danger	0
You dont really save time lane jumping and usually just increase your own frustration .	0
At least in peak hour .	0
I used to be a lead foot , till the defensive driving instructor did the calculations for us and all that weaving people do really only saves them 1-2 MINUTES max on their travel .	0
The question he asked always stuck with me because it made me think and the answer was NO .	0
And yeah that was , is 2-3 minutes to get someplace worth risking your life for .	0
Or someone elses.Different if some git is doing 40kms in a 60 zone in the right hand lane with no other traffic around : P	0
I was wondering what the hell that was at midnight..	0
Actually it was 10:30 ... . but it did n't even wake up Ian !	0
after watching an interview on a where a spokesman for the australian israeli jewish affair council explicitly said that if you question the actions of the israeli government then you are effectively anti-zionist and a card carrying member of hezzbollah .	0
i swear to god , the more and more that i learn the angrier i get .	0
what the ifuck/i are they thinking ? brand all of this bullshit where they refuse to hold a temporary ceasefire to allow foreign national tourists to safely evactuate , as fucked up and shitty as that is , has me simply livid .	0
i 'm so angry at them that i ca n't think straight .	0
i 'm so angry that i 'm shaking.brand why the hell has n't australia , or britian , or germany , or any other of america 's allies got on the horn and said that if they do n't force israel to hold a ceasefire then they 'll pull of out their wonderfully conducted art of propaganda otherwise known as the war on terror ?	1
i bet you that they 'd fucking snap to like nervous fucking field mice in the eyes of a hungry hawk .	0
I was n't referring to all of them as ragheads , but the ones needing immediate extermination happen to be wearing them .	0
I would n't refer to my Sikh friends as ragheads , despite their similarities in appearance .	0
I just recently learned that Sikhism is an offshoot of Hinduism .	0
The Hindus are such a peaceful lot that they formed a separate religion to deal with muslim aggression .	0
Ironic , no ? My over-exuberant Indian friend suggested blowing up Mecca , but that 's just preposterous .	1
I mean I might be willing to give him a hand if he helps me destroy Mt .	0
Rushmore first , but such ideas and acts of terror would accomplish nothing .	0
Save to piss an enormous population off , which is n't necessarily a bad thing , but you need to piss them off for the right reasons .	0
A lot of the message would get lost in translation I 'm afraid .	0
Questioning Israeli actions is n't anti-semitic .	0
The Israeli attacks are n't going to endear them to anyone , but they 've been dealing with this shit for so long they 're past the point of caring what the rest of the world thinks .	0
It 's not about PR , it 's about keeping it 's citizens alive .	1
If people have a problem with their tactics then that 's their bleeding heart problem .	0
`` Questioning Israeli actions is n't anti-semitic '' i know that , but those darn israeli lobby groups keep telling me otherwise	0
I suspect it 's because this time ( unlike many other times ) agressions were begun my the syria-iran supported hezzbollah ( though it 's more PC to spell it hizzbullah now ) .	0
That said , everybody just needs to stop .	0
I liked the Norwegian take on it all- they told Israel they were evacuating , loaded themselves onto a bus literally draped with Norwegian flags , and got out .	1
Very no-nonsense .	0
No offense , but I do n't think australia telling israel to do anything would have any effect .	0
we did the whole convey-draped in flags thing as well .	0
we probably did it first : ) of course , when we got to the city that we were being evacuated to to be met by a boat , we were told that it had been previously booked and that we couldn ; t have it .	0
so we 've got hundreds of citixens lining up on sidewalks in the middle of a war torn country waiting for some ships that were'nr coming .	0
they 're still there , as of an hour and a half ago , as well.israel would n't be in this position if they didn ; t put themselves there .	0
i do n't think australia should tell israel what to do .	1
australia should get on the phone to you damned yankees and let you politely know that unless you stop your nasty little friend from attacking our civilians for a little while at least then we 'll actively review our free trade and our participation in the war on terror .	0
while we 're really only there for the p.r .	0
the p.r .	0
is really important for you guys in that area so ...	0
They do n't do it because they know that it wo n't get them anywhere .	1
The Israel Lobby is one of the most powerful in Washington , and has a profound effect on US foreign policy .	0
If you 're up for a lot of reading , or a bit of skimming , try : a from March this year.I 'm with you though , I find the whole thing reprehensible .	0
then let the israel lobby provide the special force troops and the photo ops with foreign dignitarities for legitimacy purposes that the war on terror desperately needs .	0
Any citizen , foreign or otherwise , that 's staying in an area that has publicly elected hostile militants into their government for the sole purpose of launching attacks on a neighboring country should 've thought about that before they moved to the god-damned area .	0
What the fuck were ithey/i thinking , huh ?	0
the fact that they are lebanese-australians who were over visiting relatives who do n't really get to decide who their neighbours are in an area with no real variety in housing options probably can explain a few things : )	0
What 's really pissing me off is watching a liberal reporter tour damaged areas of Lebanon with a representative of Hezbollah while he whines about what the Israelis are doing to their cities .	1
WTF ?	0
Maybe if your rag-headed leader had n't ordered the invasion of Israel , and the kidnapping of troops they would n't be shelling the fuck out of your little hidey holes , which happen to be in civilian areas .	0
Cowardly fucks .	0
And the reporter is eating it up , when he should be kicking the fucker 's ass for assuming the rest of the world is as stupid as they are.Oh , and the whiney ass , self-ed , American bitch that could n't understand why she was n't being evacuated immediately .	0
`` The Italians , and French got their people out .	0
Why have n't we been evacuated yet ?	0
We 're American !	0
`` I hope a missile hits her in her stupid , Gucci wearing , spoiled ass .	0
why 'd you have to call them ragheads ?	0
surely you could have called them any number of other names before using that one .	0
dickheads is my personal favourite at the moment.in the face of overwhelming military superiority , guerilla warfare tactics are the best way to go .	1
it 's shitty , but that 's the only avenue left to them .	0
and i do n't think that israel has much of a leg to stand on ith a choice of their targets at the moment .	1
reports are coming out that they 've been bombing schools , hospitals , restaurants etc .	0
Does anyone else sometimes randomly just see their Livejournal get stripped of CSS and shown nekkid ? I kind of like it , in a perverse way .	1
It 's like a metaphor for how Livejournal is a collapsing ruin , things fall apart , the can not hold , etc .	0

I want him to come to my house so we can play jump rope	0
A warm-up ?	0
I am the monkey 's uncle !	0
; ) If that is gouache , I am impressed .	1
I agonize over gouache !	0
Hahah it is a warm up !	1
It 's just a little quick thing .	0
And yes , it is gouache !	0
I use Holbein Acryla Gouache for all my paintings , it 's my favourite kind : D	0
my name is aliceI live in a palace	0
that commercial and the robert goulet mixed nuts commercial are two of the greatest of all time	0
You say warm up I say fully formed spot illustration.Does he actually wear a happy kitten shirt ?	0
Or did you just stick it on there ?	0
Because that is so awesome .	0
Aw thanks pal ! HAHAH !	0
No , he does n't have a happy kitten shirt .	0
But I feel like he would totally wear one if he had one !	0
I need to be his friend and give one to him for Christmas .	0
Rad !	0
I love the ghosts in there too .	0
Thanks !	0
Yeah I just tossed a bit of masking fluid down on the paper before I did the wash to make those little guys	0

The top one is closer to what you 'd see in those magazines .	0
Because they printed on a very cheap grade of paper they tended to go for high contrast saturated colours ( that then got greyed down by the paper ) ... but it 's the *choice* of colours too , somehow the aesthetic is very much of that time and place .	0
I 'm really drawn to the way this new camera deals with color !	0
( and b/w for that matter ) I want to go back and re-shoot everything I 've done with it !	0

OH wait , flowers ! ! !	0
So pretty , thank you .	0
So pretty !	0
I like the first and third ones best- the lines are so crisp , and it almost looks like they 're glowing .	1
Yes ...	0
I loved this aspect as well ... and it really pops out with the soft light sources .	0
What colors ! ! ! !	0
I love these : )	0
Thank you .	0
I loved these shots !	0
My favorites were the first , third and last ones .	0
Thanks so much for posting .	0
Thank you ... it 's interesting ...	0
I almost did not post the third one !	0
i always love your flower shots !	0
: ) the last one is my favorite ... such vibrant colors !	1
Thanks ... you obviously have me on speed dial !	0
I was still making an adjustment to the entry when your comment came in !	0
talk about girlie parts , this one made me blush .	0
i 've never seen pistils and stamens that close .	0
this is almost floraporn .	0

Yeah ...	0
I 've often had difficulty really seeing the two things as different visually .	0
# 3 is awesome ... especially the leaf curling around the stem : )	0
Yeah ...	0
I really liked the leaf curling too .	0
the first and last ... the colours had me time travelling to cold-war-era Hungarian propaganda newspapers	0
Interesting that you would pick those two since they are from different cameras .	0
I 'm not sure what that propaganda looked like ... but if it was color like this ... WOW !	0
We all know how much I absolutely disdain the Twilight ... *shudder* phenomenon .	1
We all know vampires should n't sparkle , and that Buffy would stake Edward before we could have that horrible Reneesmee ( oh jesus ) birthing scene in the 4th movie .	0
I still do n't know how they 'll do that , to be honest.So I ask you all : a THE SHIT IS THIS ?	0
WHAT .	0
THE SHIT.An except , if I may : '' And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.Twilight has quickly become a worldwide phenomenon developing a strong core base of dedicated fans who are drawn to the story of a Romeo and Juliet style romance between mortal ( Bella ) and vampire ( Edward ) .	0
Who better to capture the young star-crossed love of these two characters than Barbie and Ken .	0
Edward is luminescent with a shimmering complexion and trademark gold eyes .	0
Bella doll sold separately .	0
`` I 'm sorry , but if this is a Romeo and Juliet style romance , then they would both be dead by the end of the third act .	0
OH HA HA BARBIE .	0
I SEE WHUT YOU DID THAR .	0
I have n't seen the movie or read any of the books ... .Not my glass of beer , I guess.Cam .	0
Oh jebus .	0
: : makes being sick noises : :Thank god I am not the only one looking at the Twilight phenomenon and going WTF ?	0
The film was so boring and when he started to glitter in the sunlight both my husband and I yelled at the screen .	1
Vampires ... are cool .	0
Vampires are scary .	0
Vampires are Lestat .	0
Vampires are Dracula .	0
Vampires are Blade ( Sorry ... but I love that franchise ) Not some glowy twit with serious teenage angst .	0
ARGH ! I have also noticed a considerable rise in the number of vampire books being published .	0
Sigh.I really want to buy that doll for my husband as it would probably not end like romeo and juliet , probably more like Hamlet .	0
Dude , I know .	0
Everyone 's cashing in on the vampires lately .	0
I ca n't go to a bookstore without some twit behind the counter recommending me Twilight when I ask for good sci-fi/fantasy books.Seriously though , that doll looks like it would eat me in my sleep .	0
I never thought I 'd see a doll that ACTUALLY gave me the willies , but congratulations Mattel .	0
You win.I 'm gon na go cry into my copy of 'Interview with a Vampire ' now .	0
Aaaagh ! ! !	0
I must stab my eyes out after seeing this .	0
Although I just saw a wonderful mash-up of Buffy Vs Edward where someone took bits of Buffy and bits of Twilight and had Buffy stake Edward.I tried to read the first book to see what the fuss was about and I could n't even get half-way through .	0
It hurt so .	0
SEND ME THAT MASH-UP .	0
I must see it !	0
I know several people who would LOVE IT.That 's okay , the plot does n't show up until after vampire baseball anyway .	0
You did n't miss much .	0

I have season one of iBSG/i and season one of iHeroes/i sitting on the shelf , I have still to get round watching either of them.Which is a bit daft , as I 'm sure I will like iBSG/i as I loved DS9 and it 's the some of the same creators and themes.FF	0
I was thinking exactly what you were thinking about emGlee/em .	0
And the love triangle is a very boring one .	0
I want to know more about the other kids too .	0
My only big smile moment was Kurt 's dad knowing Kurt was gay since he was a tot , lovely little scene , playing against the dad 's macho image .	1
Well there 's just been an ep which dealt exactly with the white kids getting all the attention !	0
I still think it 's great i must admit .	0
Yes , I 'm still enjoying it too - but it is a bit a of a guilty pleasure .	0
OMG , that duvet cover is so you !	0

I am quite envious that you get the 2nd series of Being Human while we in the USA have to wait ! I truly loved the 1st series when it was shown here on BBC America .	1
I am keeping my fingers crossed that we get to see the new series sometime this year .	0
It 's still really , really good .	1
Wonderful characters , funny , poignant , sometimes scary stories .	0
I forgot to add : Annie and George were why I watched , too .	0

Since all the LibraryThingers are doing it , the 2007 book poll .	0
I only started actually keeping track in October and I do n't actually own most of the books I read , so I 'm sure I 've forgotten many , and a few from 2006 may have slipped onto the list .	1

Today , I count myself among those ranks .	0
There 's mistaking one drive for another .	0
No big .	0
But mistaking your external drive for the ( extremely ) expendable , empty drive that you 're slaving just to format ?	0
; ____ ; *hug*Was it a full format or a quick format ?	0
Embarrassingly , I ca n't say for sure , but a quick format may have just wiped the file index .. so all the raw data would be still there if you used recovery software.I think .	0
Danke , CrisuIt was a quick format ( a type I normally avoid but thankfully did n't in this case ) , so I 've been running recovery scans on the drive .	0
Everything I 've recovered so far has been corrupted , so hopefully I 'll have better luck with a different sort of scan.It 's terribly frustrating to be able to see every .	0
single .	0
file .	0
that 's on the hard drive , having the recovered file be about the same size as the old one , and then it just ca n't be opened .	0
This is driving me insane !	0
Just got ta keep telling myelf that I scanned this all in , so it 's still recoverable , I did n't lose anything permanently except hours of work but it 's not gone forever , etc , etc.Agh , damn , my brain .	0
ouch ; o ;	0
NOOOO .	0
; ___ ;	0
YEEEES ; _ ;	0
No ... it 's all gone ?	0
Yup .	0
All the raws for the site , everything .	0
What happens now ?	0
Lots of work ... Got ta sit down and rescan everything OTLI 'm so glad I did n't throw away the volumes like I had planned.Considering each volume can take 2+ hours to scan ( and even MORE time to touch up ) , I can kiss my week goodbye .	0
And here I was looking forward to gaming time once the kids started school =/	0
You throw away the volumes ?	0
lol not yet .	0
I was just thinking , since they were debound , that I did n't have much use for them .	0
But I was considering giving pages away for donation prizes , but that 's sort of shitty , is n't it ?	0
Well , the gist of it is I 'm still undecided , and that 's why I had n't thrown anything away yet.Still , I did find out that it 's somewhat possible to unformat a drive ( especially one that 's been quick formatted as I did - hooray for laziness ! ) .	0
So I had the computer on all last night to do a scan , and the program did read my original layout , which is a good sign .	0
Only problem is , after I set up the recovery , it got the files just fine ... they 're just corrupted .	0
I knew it was too good to be true OTL	0
I have an interview tomorrow and I 'm so nervous !	1
I had to do loads of individual interviews to pass the Commisions Board for the Army last July but this is a group interview .	0
I do n't even know what one of those is but just the name worries me .	0
I 'm no good at talking in front of groups of people tht I do n't know when I do n't actually know what I 'm supposed to do .	0
I may not have an acute phobia of crowds like I used to but I still have some hang-ups .	0
Why oh why ca n't they be arsed to do proper interviews .	0
At least I know I can do okay in them =/I do n't even want to work in that shop .	1
I mean Topshop ... . blegh it 's so stylish and normal .	0
I 'm officially selling out to get money .	0
If the last paragraph made no sense then why not develop some English skills and try again.Your quote does n't anger me , it actually made me laugh .	0
Me , judgemental ?	0
XD I 'm the most open-minded person I know .	1
My friends are of all races , social backgrounds , religions and sexualities .	0
I never tell people that I 'm right and they 're wrong .	0
You 're the only one of us who is judgemental to the point of 'sin ' .	0
The bible teaches you to love everyone and not to judge .	0
'Let him who is without sin cast the first stone ' .	0
Jesus/God is the only one permitted to judge people in your religion .	1
You seem to be doing a good job in forgetting that with all of your 'you will go to hell ' talk .	0
How very un-Christian of you .	0
Carry on trying to argue with me if you will , but you wo n't get anywhere .	1
I have no problem with Christianity .	0
It is a beautiful message to humanity and although I do n't believe that Jesus was the son of your God , I have a lot of respect for his teachings .	0
No , it 's the Christians like you that piss me off .	1
You act so 'holier than thou ' but at the end of the day , you try to put everyone into little socially conforming boxes and judge them by that .	0
My friends are of all races , social backgrounds , religions and sexualities.What is your problem ?	0
I never said anything about having issues with other races .	0
You make so many false accusations and it 's getting really annoying .	0
I never accused you of racism .	0
I was merely stating that I am not judgemental in the least as you seemed to imply .	0
Well you seemed to imply that I was racist .	0
And I was talking about my friends stupid .	0
I 've never heard you be racist nor assumed you were racist so sorry if you felt I implied such a thing .	0
Do you mean that you were talking about your friends being judgemental or your friends thinking I am judgemental ?	0
I had a group interview once when I applied at Hollywood Video a while back .	0
It was me and two other people , and basically the interviewer just sat us down in a room and asked us questions , and we 'd take turns answering , and at times she 'd ask us questions that just pertained to ourselves that the others did n't have to answer.It was n't too bad .	0
I wish you luck !	0
can you please take me off your friend list ?	0
If that 's what you want .	0
Personally I think that it 's a little immature to ask such a thing just because you do n't use littleoogie anymore .	1
It 's not like I was involved in your removal from the site .	0
I 've only ever defended myself , not insulted you .	0
Whatever .	0
Maybe I just do n't like you .	0
Then go cram your twisted views of the bible down someone elses throat ( yes they are twisted .	0
Most of the people you insulted know more about the bible than you ) Maybe one day you 'll learn to question things and not accept every little thing you are told to believe .	0
Until then , leave this bisexual pagan to 'sin ' in peace.I never could stand narrow-minded , ignorant bigots and I only put up with you because you are young .	0
Go do some soul searcching and grow up .	0
Wow , somebody 's grumpy .	1
All I said was i dont like u and you bring up every wrong thing I 've done since you met me .	0
And I never crammed my twisted veiws down your throat , I simply told you that I was right and you were wrong .	0
And no , they do n't know more about the Bible than me .	0
They just think they do .	0
And there 's nothing wrong with being a narrow-minded , ignorant bigot .	0
And maybe I do n't want to grow up .	0
Maybe I 'd like to enjoy my childhood while it still exists , I only have a couple more years .	0
Let 's review shall we .	0
In the last post you admitted to doing 'wrong ' things and yet you claim to be 'right ' whereas I 'm wrong .	0
You are almost as hypocritical as the book you claim to know so well .	0
And yet , for example , when the topic of ghosts was brought up , you claimed not to believe in them .	0
When asked 'but did n't one appear in the bible ' you adamantly replied 'no ' .	0
But it did .	0
Hence these people know it better than you .	1
There is a fine line between clinging to your childhood and being old before your time .	0
To be quite frank , you sound like my 91 year old Great-Grandmother .	0
For her it 's excusable as she was born when times where very different .	1
In you the trait is most repulsive .	0
There is EVERYTHING wrong with being a bigot .	1
Think Nazi Germany .	0
I meant all the things you thought I did wrong , which actually were n't wrong .	0
And I meant ghosts that just go around haunting houses and stuff , not spirits sent from God .	0
And I know the Bible way better than them .	0
And that last paragraph made no sense at all .	0
And just to annoy you , here 's the quote of the day : Time to put the mental in judgemental !	0

I got me some mona-mail today , and I am really trying to figure out what to send a painting in .	0

It gets my crush high a bopin .	0
Tomorrow means mail sending , job applying , and magic-o-tone music for my ears .	0

I recently redesigned my website to be simpler , and load much more quickly , so now it 's in html instead of flash .	0
( Better to read you on a mobile device , my dear .	0
) Anyway , with this transition a few weeks ago I added a Wordpress account so that I could have a place to post my ongoing photos , which iyes , /i I do that here too , but a livejournal that I 've written in since 2001 ( 9th grade !	0
ha ) is n't so reputable.Sooo , here is the link : a Add it to your Google Reader or Blogroll or whatever you use , please.The main site is n't fully working yet , like videos loading quickly , but the blog is done .	0
For the most part I wo n't be posting here anymore except for comments and communities .	0
So if you want to keep updated on anything in my life , head on over.a shopThat is all = )	0

are you a professional photographer ?	0
if not , what do you do ?	0
Well , I went to school for digital design so my profession revolves around motion graphics and interaction .	0

i need to get a google reader or something .	0
instead i 've been sitting at home watching tv shows on the internet , letting my unread delicious bookmarks stack up and chattingandmaking drinks with my roommate .	0
oh motivation , you are illusive .	0
Motivation is hard .	0
It took me like 3 years to get a reader and I do n't know why I did n't before , it is extremely daunting to have to click the sites I want to read on to see if they 've updated .	0
( Or at least , it is when they number in the hundreds .	0
) Anyway , one downside is that the design of google reader is kinda ugly so I 'd suggest installing this custom CSS to the page so it is a lot better designed .	1

eat a cider donut for me.PS i miss you	0
it makes my chest hurt , too .	0

Upon my most recent visit , I saw a lawn with flowers that spelled out Norwegian Wood .	0
It 's one of the only places I have ever felt truly at peace .	0
I empathize , truly !	0
I live very close to the norwegian wood place !	0
You are so lucky !	0
That lawn really stuck out in my mind .	0
Sometimes we have to leave our home to find it ... hopefully you have the luxury of returning to CT every now and then .	0
We did it .	0
All of us .	0
We worked and phonebanked and volenteered and gave more money than we could afford , and god , we did it .	0
Tonight I walked through the city and saw it reborn .	0
We hugged and danced in the streets .	0
We high fived and set off fireworks and smiled at stangers .	0
Union Square was a mob scene .	0
We knew triumph and redemption .	0
We got a smarty pants big city guy with a funny name elected president , despite having everything against us .	0
We took our country back.God bless you President Obama .	0

It 's time for someone with some intelligence .	0
Eight years was too much .	0
Why would anyone want Joe the Plumber for president ?	0
Where are these people 's brains ?	0
Is it that the mediocre love the mediocre ?	0
Is there no respect for education ?	0
Does having a brilliant academic career mean nothing ?	0
Evidently , some people would rather elect someone with whom they would enjoy having a beer .	0
I 'd rather elect someone who is competent .	0
I , and many other people , just did ! My apologies for the rant .	0
In total agreement !	0
Kitty and I were in our honeymoon cabin , bundled up on the couch watching Indecision '08 .	0
When Jon Stewart announced `` Barack Obama is the next president of the United States ! ''	0
we changed it to CNN .	0
When they confirmed , we kissed , ran out on the porch overtop the French Broad river , and I screamed for joy at the mountains on the other bank .	0
One of those nights you remember forever.Thanks to everyone who helped make this happen .	0
Would you rather have someone who is breathtakingly beautiful ( we 're talking the hottest thing you have ever seen , pick your jaw up off the floor hot ) but spectacularly dumb ( as in , you ca n't use words more than two syllables around them without having to explain yourself ) , orSomeone who is downright plain ( and that 's being kind ) but is utterly brillant , with whom you can have sparkling conversations and they teach you all sorts of things ? and , this is the big part : Why ?	0
Ah , the `` why '' -- because fun conversation remains fun longer than beauty remains entrancing , to me .	0
But all things are never equal , no two real people would be so perfectly alike in personality that the choice would come down to those factors .	0
And neither is the most important to me , because neither is something a person can control .	0
A plain person can do some things to improve their beauty , and a dumb person can do some things to improve their intelligence , but at the end of the day there 's a natural limit that they were born with and must live with .	0
A person can control iwho they really are/i , though .	0
They can choose to be kind or not , trustworthy or not , etc .	0
One of my adopted brothers is a real sweetheart , but he 'll never be even averagely intelligent .	0
He ca n't help it .	0
His birth mother drank while she was pregnant with him , and he must live with the consequences .	0
I hope so much for him that he 'll find someone who sees him for the sweetheart he is , rather than the einstein he is n't .	0
I have been handed this decision in the past , and have always , always chosen the smart one .	0
Smart is sexy .	1
All-nighter rambling stream-of-consciousness conversations are hotter than ANY face/body combo .	0
Period .	0
Always ( for me ) .	0
Assuming height-weight proportionate in both cases , which can make a difference.Plain.Looks are n't everything .	1
In fact , they usually lead to an artificially inflated sense of worth for the attractive person , and attitudes which usually piss me off to no end .	0
Plus they 'll likely be bad at sex , having never had to put much effort into it and not the intelligence to realize how much fun it can actually be .	0
The 'plain ' girl probably has plenty of things that make her beautiful , if one looks .	0
And there are many measures for that .	0
The intelligence would be a definite aphrodisiac , assuming she knew how to apply it to the situation.Then there are the girls who are pretty dang hot but seem to think they 're plain , yet happen to be Mensa material , AND are flexible as hell and passionate to no end in bed .	0
THOSE are the ones I look for .	0
Drink them up like fine wine .	0
PS , where you been at ?	0
I 've not gotten to talk to you in a while .	0
Hiding .	0
In your closet .	0
That late night crashing noise ?	0
Yeah , that 's me .	0
I choose plain and utterly brilliant because sparkling conversations and learning is smexy .	0
Such a person is interesting and will continue to be interesting and fun to be with .	0
And theres always something beautiful to be found if one looks close enough .	0
No matter how hawt the face/body if they 're spectacularly stupid its a real turn off .	1
Its like seeing something seemingly perfect rot right in front of your eyes once the stupidity appears .	0
Maybe one could ignore it for awhile , but boredness with the lack of intelligence would set in sooner or later .	0
Also , I second the inflated egos and aggravating additudes mentioned above .	0
Although , occassionally there may be one that is very sweet and tries hard at everything , which can balance it somewhat .	0
Altough , you know of course that gorgeous and brilliant is always welcome .	0
andlt ; 333	0
Brilliant and ugly , hands down .	0
But , the answer is very personal to me .	0
Being a being who has spent a good deal of her life interacting with the world through books , writing , and the internet , physicality means very little in my interest of someone .	0
Though , that does n't mean that I do not sometimes find a lovely being who does make me stare and drool and stare.Also , it is a very interesting experience that when one is in love , the  of one 's love inevitably becomes more physically attractive and handsome/beautiful , and as well , sometimes reshapes my idea of what is physically attractive.I really could not abide much time at all interacting with someone who was unintelligent .	0
All other things being equal , I 'd take the intelligent plain one over the dumb beauty .	1
Except if they were both jerks , in which case I 'd stay single .	0
Intelligence and beauty are certainly plusses , but when it comes right down to it , what I 'm really looking for is someone who 's kind , honest , sincere , trustworthy , loyal , and who loves me .	0
I am a Capitalist Whore ! !	1

Taking a break from the happy things posts .	1
Because Christmas is making me rabid with rage .	0
There is no good reason for the news presenter to announce Important Breaking News to let us know that Santa has officially left the North Pole .	0
Especially when the Santa looks like a Fritzl .	0
They even had a stupid computer generated flight path mapped with Santa Fritzl flying between skyscrapers and some expert talking about how Santa bends space and time itself.Maybe I 'll just go hang myself with some tinsel or try and slash my wrists with a turkey baster .	0
Christmas is ridiculous.For I am the Grinch.img	0
Haha , Santa leaving is IMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS ?	0
Wow.I mean , that 's sort of a relief from seeing all the bad stuff that usually goes on .	0
It was so lame , I felt so ashamed and I was n't even the idiot saying it ! Even if some dreadful event had occured I 'm pretty sure they still would have gone ahead with their important breaking news Santa story .	0
Stupid tv .	1
christmas is putting a huge amount of stress on me and causing so much anxiety .	1
and that doesnt even get into the money im spending when im broke and i have rent coming up ... and all these manditory family encounters that stress me the fuck out , the rest of the year im pretty successful at avoiding my parents .	0
but then the holidays come around and there is really no escaping them .	0
Arrrgh , I guess I 'm lucky in that I do n't really have much family so all I have to worry about is my grumpy Dad.At least you have your sister there to remind you to breathe , it 's such a shitty time of year especially with worrying about money as it is .	0
You really do n't need the added crazy of family on top of it all .	0
I hope you have a good one though or at least a mediocre one .	0
My family ceased normal x-mas stuff when mom and dad split.Now we call .. send cards and if we see something we know someone can use or would like .. we get it , regardless the time of year ...	0
When did your parents split ?	0
Like , how old were you ?	0
Because that completely sucks if it was while you were still pretty young.It sounds like a nice situation though , that you all get in contact and make an effort for each other .	0
in many ways mom and dad splitting was not normal ... they remained friends until he remarried , and now it 's just awkward for them to talk much ...	0
I was in college when they split ... but my youngest sibling was 12 and I think it was rough on him .	0
not holiday stuff , just the split in general .	0
Oh , that 's got to have been strange .	0
I mean , when the parents remain friends there 's always that subconcious hope that they might , maybe get back together or perhaps they 've made a big mistake by splitting.Gah , I can see why it was so rough for your brother .	1
12 is such a fragile age !	0
ya it is , and in some respects , part of him is still back there in time .	0
well if we have the money to do so of course ... LOL	0

This is a great , great record .	1
I keep hearing people say things like `` best record since Element of Light '' and `` Best Record since I Often Dream of Trains '' -- I 'm hesitant to say that kind of thing because I 'm not a critic ; but it is certainly in a league with Robyn 's very best work .	0
The Venus 3 come together as a band in a way I do n't think they really did on O ' Tarantula , and it just touches me very deeply .	0

Right now I 'm visiting at my mom 's house .	0
Some kids came up to the door banging on it a million times and ringing the doorbell a crapload of times .	0
When I did n't answer the door , some lady screamed , Turn your damn porch light off then ! Fuck you , bitch .	0
I do n't have to do SHIT to my house -- - it 's YOUR children who are trespassing on my mom 's property , not me .	1
Get fucked.Breeders are so disgusting .	0
Well.You do n't owe it to them or anything , but it is kind of shitty to have your lights on on Halloween when you are n't there / are n't planning to answer .	0
Now normally I would agree , to be courteous , but I was just visiting her house and the lady who yelled at me was SO rude about it .	0
Like it was the WORST crime ever because we accidentally left our light on .	0
They ( or someone but probably them ) threw an egg at my mom 's house later .	0
... bitches .	0
srsly .	0
we 're at my nana and papa 's house in auburndale and it 's like the happenin ' neighborhood to bring your kids to trick or treat ( because it 's nice and safe I guess ) , so we put up a sign on the door that clearly said , New Baby sleeping !	1
Please do not disturb !	0
and we still had four or five kids knock and ring the doorbell .	0
the porch light was off too .	0
jerks .	1
see , that 's what I do n't get .	0
I can understand why people knocked on our door at least ( although not the part about them harrassing/egging us ) but to do what they did to you guys is just rude .	0

hey when do you play ?	0
my roomies are big BLZBLU fans and my ex specifically plays rachel as well .	0
I liked ur combos .	0
Is your username GeneralKite ?	0
thats what i can tell from the video .	0
How are you playing this , Xbox or PS3 ?	0
roomie says : After ending the combo with a sword poke and staggering them , instead of using a lightening rod , try using a frog instead .	0
Also , immediately after you put the frog out , do 3c towards the enemy .	0
Its sets up for really nice follow-ups with an air throw or something similar .	0
frog is usually too far out unless its against a wall .	0
and even so the enemy techs sometimes to the direction of the frog going passed it .	0
iuno ... all the properties seem goofy .	0
im still getting used to the game .	0
im still under 200 games on my live account.GENERALKITE xboxlive :3	0

As a film with both New Orleans and frog themes , how could we resist going ?	0
I was favorably impressed .	1
I 'm not a big fan of post-WWII Disney animation , but I think this is one of their best .	0
The animation is excellent , with interesting effects such as different styles for sequences showing characters ' fantasies .	0
Interesting characters and pretty good plot , with a good amount of nuance to keep things interesting for the adults in the audience while entertaining the kiddies .	0
The use of sterotype Southern accents , a I 've mentioned too common in films set in New Orleans was unfortunately not avoided , and at first was quite distracting .	0
I thought just a couple plot of twists were too incredible even after accepting the conceits of people changed into frogs and talking animals .	0
The comic relief scruffy Cajun lightning bug and the Voodoo Shadow Man villian characters were overly broad.Overall , however , very well done : fun , some genuine laughs .	1
Reccomended .	0
Though he was overly broad ( and the stereotype bad guy ) , I kinda liked Shadow Man .	0
I 've been in a few tarot discussions on his use of cards and how they were drawn ( by the animators , that is ) .	0
I 'd like to see a full deck based on the movie , but I wo n't hold my breath.While I was in the bookshop looking for presents , there was Tiana 's Cookbook , but I did n't get it because it was too girly for my nephew .	0
Sam and Jorie went to see it , and liked it .	0
Sam had been worried about various forms of Fail implied by the trailers but reports that the movie itself does much better .	0
I loved the movie despite the exaggerations and innaccurate accents..	0
I thought it was something Walt would have made if he were alive at 108. ; P There 's a show about the making of the film still at the NOMA still I think.. til April .	0

Ca n't believe I 've gone this long without a political rant .	0

Health care legislation ?	0

Otherwise I 'll just throw up or grind my teeth into little shards.I 've mainly been preoccupied by searching for a new job .	0
Nothing yet .	0
I could rant about that for a while , but it would be even less interesting than usual .	0
It is frustrating , though , how every single job I 'm qualified for requires me to be outgoing .	0
How is an introvert supposed to find an entry-level job ?	0
We 're apparently supposed to fake it .	0
Yeah , basically .	0
XD I am very high on the Introversion scale according to Meyers-Briggs , and in fact identify quite strongly as an introvert .	0
But I 'm lucky enough to be able to fake it pretty damn well ...	0
I have impeccable work-with-others skills .	0
I do not prefer it , but by nature I am submissive , noncombative , noncompetitive , and relatively easygoing , which means I can pull it off and generally people describe me as easy to work with.Now granted , a job that would n't phase an extrovert will often suck me dry and I have to go home and do self-care for sometimes quite a while before I 'm recovered enough to handle the rest of my day , but I can do it.BLA !	0
Yeah , after having to encounter a ton of people I just want to GET AWAY and it 's not really understood in American culture where being quiet and wanting to be alone is supposed to always be a cause for concern .	0
Yep I was going to suggest exactly what span class='ljuser ljuser-name_anne_jumps ' lj : user='anne_jumps ' style='white-space : nowrap ; 'a href= ' src= ' alt= ' [ info ] ' width='17 ' height='17 ' style='vertical-align : bottom ; border : 0 ; padding-right : 1px ; ' /a href= ' suggested .	0
FAKE IT TIL YOU MAKE IT or whatever that really annoying expression is .	0
I do n't know exactly how you go about that though .	0
The problem is n't really that I ca n't fake it ( although sometimes I ca n't ) , it 's more that it leaves me absolutely exhausted and loathing my job .	0
It depends on the job .	0
The thing to do is find one that has limited interaction with people .	0
That 's not always easy , but still .	0
Receptionist work , for example , is absolutely right out for me .	0
Technical writing ?	0
Great .	0
iAny time a Republican says something ?	0
Change the channel right away .	0
Otherwise I 'll just throw up or grind my teeth into little shards./iI 've been listening to news less lately , too .	0
It 's just all so out of control.About the job thing , I 've always just faked outgoing-ness .	0
In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it 's not an overly social environment like most other jobs I 've had have been ( which is probably the main reason I do n't have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I do n't have to be that outgoing .	0
You ca n't really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close ... But probably that will be hard to find in this economy .	1
It seems like all the jobs out there are sales , or customer service , and neither is pleasant .	0
You might just have to fake it to the max for a while : (	0

but then maybe it 's a fantastic idea .	0
either way.. nah .	0
ints very subjective though .	1
i mean what seems inane to you might be important to everyone else .	0
anyway its not for the tate fecking modern , its just for fun .	0
i just finished it : ) i did it from mid last year .	0
i did n't so self portraits - just took photos of anything .	0
i really enjoyed i and love seeing other peoples ! ! !	0
you should def do it .	1

hmm ... . my camera is nothing special but I want to try !	0
ok excellent .	0
i will put up a post about it but maybe we 'll start mon , or wed , mid week .	0

nope , not today .	0
i 'll let you know xx	0
I have often thought about doing something like this .	0
A few years ago , one of my old art teachers suggested I should do it with her artgroup but then..stupidly I didn't.I think this would be great fun , and interesting .	0
I love keeping a journal etc too so seems only natural .	1
About 12 hours ago Matoko and I made the tough decision that it was time for her cat , Baldric ( aka , bodge ) , to be put to sleep .	1
He 's been fighting off heart troubles , hyperthyroid , and possible kidney issues , and last night , after his latest downturn , we were told that he was experiencing massive kidney failure .	0
He was n't eating , was getting sores in his mouth , and though the vet did say there was a chance to bring him around , it simply would n't last .	0
In the end , I think he was glad that we could all be together when his time came .	0
He sat with us , purred his love for Liz , and then settled down for the injection itself .	0
He was asleep in moments.The house is a little emptier , now , without our big black fighter of a cat .	0
But he 's in a far better place , and he was loved every minute of his life.Ca n't ask more than that.PS .	0
Liz does n't have her phone with her today , so if anyone wants to contact her , use her gmail or just leave a note here .	0
Sleep well , big guy.Poor Bodge .	0
: ( Hugs to you both .	0
I 'm so sorry for your loss .	0
Glad to hear he had a good long life and was loved .	0
andlt ; 3	0
RIP Bodgie .	0
The cyber-kitty is no more .	0
I have many memories of living with him - he was a cat amongst cats .	1
He could bail up cat feeders in the corridor with his hulking shadow and glowing green eyes , he could bite your chin with pinpoint accuracy and keep you warm in the winter .	0
Bye , bye Baldric.Gabby	0
Thanks guys .	0
Liz is reading this , but she does n't trust herself to reply to anything at the moment .	0
She does appreciate the love , though .	0
I 'm really sorry to hear about that .	0
Hugs to the both of you .	0
Yeah , massive kidney failure is usually the end of the journey for a cat .	0

After my post a bit earlier in Windows Safari , span class='ljuser ljuser-name_kurisu ' lj : user='kurisu ' style='white-space : nowrap ; 'a href= '' ' alt= ' [ info ] ' width='17 ' height='17 ' style='vertical-align : bottom ; border : 0 ; padding-right : 1px ; ' /a href= ' posted a fascinating article on the differences between Windows and OS X ( and now Safari for Windows ) font rendering , which has puzzled me for ages.A quick summary is that Apple want the fonts to look nice , whereas Microsoft want the text to be more readable .	0
I think it 's fair to say that neither is `` better '' , but it 's interesting to see the way the different approaches go .	1
Bah .	0
[ i ] tag .	0
What a crock .	0
I understand the point , but I think Apple 's `` making the fonts look nice '' make the fonts look terrible .	0
It 's not just a readability aspect , they actually look worse.I could see having such rendering for a print-based application , Word or something , but for a web browser , which is [ i ] not [ /i ] meant to go on paper , I think it 's a terrible idea .	1
A lot of people seem to prefer it , though .	0
And honestly , if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice , I 'd probably at least consider using Safari ; the stuff is more typographically `` correct '' using that rendering , which in the context of an image of a site may well look better .	0
For usability it 's probably worse , though .	0
See , that 's basically a bad idea though .	0
Remember , sub-pixel rendering is display-dependent , and not all LCDs are RGB , nor are all monitors LCD.This is n't unique to Apple 's solution , but the inability to turn the fucking shit off is a problem if you want to take a screenshot.That having been said , I 'd probably consider Safari if I wanted to print a web page and make it look nice .	0
If you want to emprint/em a webpage and make it look nice , it should n't matter what browser you 're using ( unless one has terrible layout issues for printed pages ) as the proper better printed font rendering will be used in each case .	0
You might be right , and if you are , then there 's emno/em case where Safari would be better for media , other than possibly a projector .	0
I 'm definitely right in that case , the fonts would be all pixelated when you printed out websites if I was n't ( not to mention the fact you 'd be wasting the potential of your printer many times over ) .	0
Well , I know that it 's going to rerender for a printer ( duh ) , but that does n't mean Safari 's going to use Windows ' font renderer to do it .	0
It goes to the printer in an entirely different format ; it will never use a screen font renderer .	0
Regardless of what `` renderer '' it uses , it wo n't suffer from the limitations of either of the systems .	0

I always pet it , and want to take it home , but I 'm vegetarian and I have to remember it is not just glamorous but also sort of going to bother me later .	0

At all !	0
Yay !	0
: DpI still have issues with aspects of it but it 's not consuming me like it has every year since mum died ... this is the first time in years that I have looked at a Xmas tree and thought it looks kind of pretty rather than just being disgusted with the excess of it .	1
I do n't think it 's a coincidence that this is also the year I changed my name and left my family behind .	0
I feel so much better about a lot of things in my life when they are not in it .	0
funny that !	0

... would a thief do something this dangerous and stupid.a	0
Unfortunately , not only in Indiana .	1
We 've had a couple of similar incidents in a different part of Nova Scotia , where would-be thieves knocked out power by trying to cut through live wires to steal copper .	0
They were easier to find , but not alive to press charges against .	0
Same thing happened in eastern Norway too .	0
So , there are apparently idiots in other places , but it 's interesting that they 're all in northern climes .	0
Well , maybe it 's something about winter that causes these attempted thieves to lose 30 IQ points , and think they can steal that copper without getting that electric chair effect .	1
Nope -- ca n't happen to me ...	0

Really digging that half of star .	0
Awesome !	0
Especially love the last photo .	0
i am really into shelf funguses for some reason lately ( photo 2 ) and that last lamb planter photo is blowing my mind .	1
awesomely strange , delicate , creepy and sad .	0
Cincinnati had a wicked wind storm last night , the result of the lovely Ike visiting the Midwest .	0
So as of last night about 500,000 households were without power , hopefully less are today .	0
When the kids and I went out for flashlights , water and food , there were downed trees throughout the neighborhoods , and many of the traffic lights were out .	0
Nick , due to his one zillion questions , got a bit of an education about `` power . ''	0
*grin* My home and Jim 's both lost power for a while , but it 's back .	0
.Yay ! ! !	0
So , we 're fine , and Nick has a day home because school is closed .	0
( Not sure yet about Matt , he 's at a university preschool .	0
) I hope everyone else is okay too !	0
Still no power for a couple miles around me .	0
However , home fine.Ren faire lost a large portion of its fencing - first time I 've seen the patron parking lot in probably a decade .	0
A couple buildings were damaged , and those in tents were not happy.Also , Eugenia , my fellow hair braider , lost her home - the van she lives out of was crushed by a tree .	0
I was wondering how the Ren Faire did , thanks for the info .	0
I am sorry for Eugenia losing her van ! !	0
And I am very glad you 're okay : - ) Call me and stop by the next time you visit Cinti , I have n't seen you in ages !	0
Matt 's at university ?	0
I knew your kids were smart , but do n't you think that 's pushing them a little hard ?	0
; ) Braider , sorry to hear about Eugenia 's van .	0
Heh .	0
.No , it 's Arlitt ( a a preschool run by the Early Childhood department of the University of Cincinnati .	0
Nick also went there ( and STILL misses it ) .	0
It means we 've got every type of almost every `` early childhood development '' specialist in the world on hand , to give Matt all the support he needs , along with a ratio of three highly qualified and experienced teachers to maybe 15 students per class .	0
Ca n't beat that !	1
blockquoteWhen lava pours out near the sea 's surface , tremendous volcanic explosions sometimes occur./blockquoteimg width=400 alt=dandelion/Springtime is made for adventures .	0
I need ideas .	0
I need a willing partner ! For sooooooo long , I 've known amazingly gifted people who did n't create and would-be adventurers who spent most of their time on the couch or at the bar .	0
Would a really fun idea be enough to motivate them to join me ?	0
At university , there were plenty of adventures to be had , but finding most of them took years and knowing the right people .	0
I want to circumvent all that waiting and brainstorm a few of my own for Raleigh .	0
Then perhaps I can take my new friends captive and do something , emanything/em beyond the ordinary .	0
Actually , I have n't been to my mother 's grave either .	0
Perhaps I will do it one day .	0
I suggest that you go play laser tag , dressed as you would to go out .	0
On a Friday night .	0
It would be really awesome !	0
Hm , well since you 're on a roll , how about suggesting a Clemson adventure .	0
I 'm sure you 've got some experience in that area .	0
I think my last adventure involved a picnic with vodka spiked iced tea , a late night nature trail , drunken stargazing at the lake , and then building a fort in my room and filling it with naked people and illegal substances.It was pretty sweet , to be honest .	0
Ahhh !	0
There are sooooooo many sweet places around Clemson .	0
1 ) The two near Greenville adventures I recommended above apply even better to Clemson.2 ) On Highway 187 ( off 76 ) , there are sooooo many cool fields and pastures .	0
One of them in particular has an amazing tree all by it 's lonesome that NEEDS a lazy afternoon picnic .	0
Preferably with substance use.3 ) Why did n't you come along on mine and Jeff 's summer of adventures before I moved to Japan ?	0
That was an incredible few months.4 ) The Oconee nuclear plant looks like a massive alien city at night .	0
There is a black lake somewhere around it with a little beach that is PERFECT for midnight swimming .	0
Or skinny dipping , if you dare mua ha ha ! 5 ) I 've always wanted to explore the two rundown Property of Clemson University No Trespassing houses on the left right after you turn on 28 to go to Pendleton .	0
Why do n't you ?	0
Also , the valley right across from the armory and kite hill often gets reeeeeally foggy and creepy in the wee hours of the morning .	0
It 's begging for an excursion .	1
6 ) Get yourself into Clemson 's underground tunnel system.7 ) Your last adventure sounds amazing .	0
I wish I 'd been there .	0
: ( Want to go along on some adventure next time I 'm in town ? 8 ) There 's a dam in Clemson that is n't the lake Hartwell dam across from Clemson campus ( although the Lake Hartwell dam is one of my favorite places at night -- looks like the end of the world ) .	1
It 's smaller and you can walk out on it .	0
Very cool and reeeeeeeeally crazy at night .	0
It 's in the woods .	0
Ask around.9 ) Bring a laptop , a scary movie , and some skittish friends .	0
Watch scary movie outside in the wilderness at night.10 ) If camping interests you at all , there is a PERFECT spot not far from the Clemson perimeter , about a mile or two from the road , on a long wooded peninsula that stretches over the lake .	0
I probably ca n't tell you from memory how to get there , but I could find it again.11 ) Since I arrived in Clemson , old-timers always talked about a Secret Beach that 's really amazing .	0
Rumors abound of it being flooded , but it ca n't be flooded ALL the time right ?	0
FIND IT !	0
The secret beach totally does not exist anymore .	0
I heard that they finally cleared out the land of the Newry Mill , although I ca n't confirm that.However , if you want a totally awesome ( if somewhat dorky ) adventure , I suggest letterboxing !	0
( www.letterboxing.org ) There are 283 letterboxing sites in Raleigh alone , meaning that there are adventures aplenty in your home city .	1
Newry mill is still there .	1
My bro takes his girlfriend there all the time .	0
I 've never been though .	0
: ( Where was the secret beach anyway ?	0
If you drive past the Esso Club heading towards Seneca before the road merged with the highway it was off on your right .	0
Seriously , though .	0
Letterboxing is awesome .	0
Also , if you 've never been to the old mill , the adventure I 've tried to have about 400 times and never have , would you go with me ? ?	0
Gosh , these are some of the most exciting replies I 've ever gotten from leaving a lj message .	0
I feel like I have a book of awesome missions now.Awesome torch passing .	0
Much appreciated .	0
I always feel a little guilt because I have destoyed and made something beautiful at the same time when I blow .	0
I would , but dandelions are weeds and when you take them out of people 's yards ... they are happy .	0
Do tell .	0
I mean , other that the obvious adventures in e-dating !	0
haha .	0
lately i 've been just getting in the car without a map or a plan .	0
I 've founds some of the most lovely places around Spartanburg , new secret hiding places .	0
lets go the jungle .	0
i hear that they have fun and games .	0
I 'm in .	0
Especially if this hunka hunka burnin ' love is going to be there : img in the jungle , baby !	0
Your gon na dieeeeeee !	0
let me know if someone accidentally gives you adventure ideas relating to greenville rather than raleigh.P.S .	0
I made the jump to digital photography this week with my very own Nikon DSLR , so that could be included in the adventures ...	0
Sweet !	0
I 'm jealous !	0
You are in luck , because there are plenty of places to adventure in Greenville and the surrounding areas .	1
First of all , I suggest gathering a small group of people to dress up for prom with you , and go eat dinner at Wafflehouse .	0
Bring camera , chat up the overworked waitress , profit .	0
Also , some bizarre sorts seem to frequent the top level of the downtown parking garage .	0
You can witness some clandestine meetings up there .	0
I 've always wanted to get a portable projector and start holding illegal showings of movies on the side of buildings .	0
You should do that .	0
Next , I suggest doing two things I have done which are not in Greenville , but are good strikeday/strikenight-trip adventures : I 'm sure you know about Stumphouse tunnel .	0
Walk all the way to the end without any lights .	0
Pretty scary , even in the daytime .	0
Next is a trip to the falls ... lower whitewater falls , I think they are called .	0
Anyway , we sneaked into the state park around midnight and hiked up to the falls in the dark to go stargazing .	0
You should definitely take your camera up there on a clear night -- it 's the most amazing view I 've ever had of the stars .	1
The Milky Way was bright as hell !	0
CC and I went on a walking adventure this weekend , and I 've been taking lots of pictures.My next adventure will probably be going to Dad 's grave .	0
I have n't done it yet , and I 'm scared.Suggest one for me and I 'll do it.I 'll make a promise , and I 100 % promise it will be fulfilled .	0
This summer , after all my classes have ended and my radio station responsibility has subsided , I will come visit you in Raleigh .	0
I could even bring CC .	0
But I will be at your mercy for whatever adventure you would like to do .	0
We 'll figure out the date after exams .	0
I spent most of my shift at work writing a paper .	0
I was typing in my e-mail , depending on gmail 's autosave function to save it as I went .	0
Well , internet explorer just encountered a problem and had to close and it turns out gmail was n't autosaving ( at least , not since 5pm when I had only a basic outline finished ) and my whole paper is gone .	0
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck .	0
buttdammit !	0
cockdangit !	0
That sucks .	0
My condolences on your loss .	0
The only thing to do after that is call it a day and start drinking heavily .	0
True this .	1
I was certainly in no shape to just start right over on the damn thing .	0
And so we move on to day two.a and Issue No .	0

It 's political memorabilia .	0
I have quite a lot of this sort of thing -- a Gore-Lieberman yamulkah , Jimmy Carter election posters , a button from the McGovern campaign , crazy right-wing pro-Confederate flag signs -- this is the result of having a father who 's a political reporter.3 .	0

It 's a little book called iMarked Trails for Girls/i by Grace Sloan Overton , and it 's a sort of an etiquette manual-slash-inspirational tract from 1931 .	0
It 's kind of awesome .	1
For instance , on the page opposite the `` free and exceptionally gracious '' picture , this is what it says : iAfter all , about the greatest difference between you is that boys are made to be the fathers of the world and girls are made to be the mothers .	0
Because the fathers need to be the protectors , boys are stronger and perhaps more forward and daring than girls .	0
But , whatever difference there may be in what men and women do , and in what we expect of them , these differences depend primarily on their different functions as parents .	0

I have been consciously training my typing patterns in withholding that extra space we were all taught to use between sentences from 2 to 1 space .	0
Apparently I missed the memo , and have been using 2 spaces for my entire life .	0
When did this shift occur ?	0
It has , and still does , blow my mind .	0
Though , I do appreciate the added typing room afforded from the saved spaces .	1
I mean , by now , I can now fit the word four .	0
Okay , now to save a few more spaces to spend on a more worthwhile word .	0
We were all taught French Spacing .	0
I thought this was just for the internets and email ?	0
or does this new rule apply to print as well ?	0
It applies to all sentences , including those you speak aloud .	0
Thank you !	0
Thank you !	0
I was taught the same way ( using 2 spaces between sentences ) and when I was corrected , I thought I was alone in this world .	0
There 's a conspiracy going on man .	0
Out of curiosity , does anyone else download movies ?	0
My usual leeching site , a ( that i 've used for the past year or two , after supernova.org went down ) seems to have died/gone legit/surrendered and so , i am without a source of newly dvdripped movies to download..	1
I know that you can watch some of the movies online , but that 's not quite the same.. as i 'd then upload the movie to my sibling 's server for him and the parentals to then view at leisure..	1
Tried a site and after completing the download of two movies and going to watch them via my VLC media player ( plays all/most codecs flawlessly ) , got the ominous message To play this movie , you need to download moviexplayer from X ... . googling that , i discovered that it was probably loaded with a virus/spyware/malware , and so one should n't do it and just delete the movie.. leaving me back at square one..Suggestions ?	0
Or perhaps rediscover mIRC for ( movie ) files ?	0
PirateBay and it 's membership/ratios ?	0
Something else entirely ?	0
Got a site for tv shows , but movies ?	0
Help !	0
I use Vuze .	0

I 'm a Virgin now .	0

I swear , you could post a big billboard by any of the highways here that reads : bDO N'T SLOW DOWNKEEP MOVINGMAINTAIN SPEED/band there 'd still be tangled traffic from drivers slowing down to read the thing .	0
You 're probably one of the few people who became virgins by virtue of being experienced .	0
How will the new commute be ? Barry and I live 2 blocks from a Blue Line stop that goes to Ohare , convenient yet still around 45-50 minutes .	0
Since BART does n't run that early , I 'll be driving , but it 's only 20 minutes and there 'll be no traffic at that time of day .	1
Good job and gratz on that .	0
Welcome home when you get here .	0
Welcome to my world .	0
I empathize more fully with you than I ever have before !	0
OMG , I remember driving down to redwood city a couple of times a week from SF - almost as bad as 880 around Hayward ... . All I could do was listen to NPR and hope for the best ! Hang in there , and good luck with the new job !	0

Is it any good ? 5 MINUTE CHOCOLATE MUG CAKE4 tablespoons flour�4 tablespoons sugar�2 tablespoons cocoa�1 egg�3 tablespoons milk�3 tablespoons oil�3 tablespoons chocolate chips ( optional ) �A small splash of vanilla extract�1 large coffee mug� ( MicroSafe ) Add dry ingredients to mug , and mix well.� Add the egg and mix thoroughly.�Pour in the milk and oil and mix well..Add the chocolate chips ( if using ) and vanilla extract , and mix again.�Put your mug in the microwave and cook for 3 minutes at 1000 watts.The cake will rise over the top of the mug , but do n't be alarmed ! Allow to cool a little , and tip out onto a plate if desired.EAT !	0
( this can serve 2 if you want to feel slightly more virtuous ) .And why is this the most dangerous cake recipe in the world ? �Because now we are all only 5 minutes away from chocolate cake at any time of the day or night ! �	0
With that proportion of oil to flour , it 's going to be almost fudgy , I think .	0
I 'll give this a try .	0
( Of course , I do n't have eggs , only egg whites , which means I 'll need to cut the oil down to 2T at most , but hey , that 's what experimentation is about . )	0
One of my Mah jong and Tai Chi friends said this : Hi Carol , I have done that recipe just make sure you have a BIG mug as it tends to flow over , well mine did but it is really tastyAlison ... so hopefully it 'll be yummy .	0
What do you mean 'of course ' you do n't have eggs only egg whites ?	0
It was a thinking-out-loud sort of thing .	0
iI have the flour and the sugar , so that 's set.I do n't have any milk-milk , so I 'll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I 'm not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? )	1
and with quantities in this range , there 's less tolerance for error , but that 's not bad .	0
Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg/oil mix , because I 've found that my egg white breads do n't `` hold '' the oil the same way when made with whole eggs .	1
So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1/3 , it should be okay./iAs to why I do n't have shell eggs , it 's twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking .	0
< claim id=	0
Big mug , yes : I used a one pint measuring cup ( which likely holds .5 l when all is said and done ) , and it was fine .	0
But it doubled in volume as it cooked , so yes , supersize the cup.Other than that , it 's easy and pretty good .	0
It seemed a little ... flat , though .	0
I think it needs something - a hint of cinnamon ?	0
Of orange ?	0
More vanilla ( I think I put one drop in ) ?	0
Perhaps a tablespoon of cold coffee and two tablespoons of milk ?	0
Raspberry sauce ? Actually , tipping this thing out onto a plate and dripping some raspberry jam onto it so the jam can melt as the cake cools ... That would be igood/i , I think .	0
Verdict : I 'm keeping the recipe , and I 'll try it again , I 'm sure .	0
I tried it again a few more times .	0
Adding chocolate chips was n't the answer .	1
It made it more chocolaty , but still flat .	0
( Besides , all the chocolate chips sank to the bottom , and made that area almost pure chocolate goo .	0
It had its own charm , but wow .	0
Fudge city .	0
) I tried it again last evening with a little cinnamon and a bit of ground cloves .	0
Yummy yummy yummy - not flat at all .	0
And if anything , it was actually slightly too sweet , so the next time ...	0
I 'll try it with less sugar .	0
( I 'm intrigued by this recipe .	0
Yes . )	0
..oooh , cinnamon and cloves sounds nice .	0
We 've been sprinkling cinnamon on our breakfast since someone told us it was good for blood pressure - we do n't know if it 's working cos we do n't have a blood pressure testy thingy .	0

Hope he 's tasty !	0
He should be !	0
I 'm going to have to slow cook him .	0
He 's very fat , so I think I might have to use the rack in the cooker , which slows the cooking time right down even more .	1
I 'll have to ask Fay how she cooked their rooster- he turned out very tasty .	1
They 've been on molasses for a couple of months so we 'll see if that makes a difference to the taste .	0
Yummy !	0
I hope so .	0
He has another reprieve cos Al is too busy today to do him in .	0

It 's a fairly deluxe health club , with pool , steam , sauna , free towels , etc.The one catch : you pick up the free pass from me , rather than me deliver it to you .	0

Hi , there !	0
I need your help .	0
As many of you know , I 'm going to be a House Fellow ( also called Resident Assistant , CA , etc ) in a dorm at UW-Madison .	0
For those of you heading off to college this fall or for anyone who is in or has been to college , can you tell me what are you or were you worried about ?	0
What about living in the dorms were you excited about ?	0
Scared about ?	0
Worried about ?	0
Confused , happy , unsure about ? Even if you did n't live in the dorms , what did Freshmen you or even Sophomore you have on your mind heading off to school ?	0
If you did live in a dorm , even for only a semester , what did you like and not like about your RA ?	0
What were you thinking when you moved in ? Possible topics : roommates , bathrooms/showering , classes , books , food , other residents , exams , the party scene , alcohol , sports , weekends , jobs.Thanks for your help , guys !	0
I really want to make this year great for my residents - all 75 of them !	0
- and it 's good to get other people 's perspectives on college and dorm life.Peace and love , ~~RaggedyAnndy~~/ [ ETA ] About the previous post : I did get Simba back .	0
I think freshman me wanted to know how to balance it all -- work with school and somewhat of a social life .	0
I also wanted to meet new people , which was n't hard at all ( though I personally needed a swift kick in the ass most days to do my homework ... ) .I liked that my House Fellow was pretty lenient , but he put more effort towards his MCAT ( with reason to ) second semester .	0
( And haha , I was on the substance-free floor in Witte , so the party scene involved ... lots of gaming .	0
And going to Ed 's .	0
XP ) Good luck !	0
You 're gon na do great .	0
I hope it 's not too late , just going through the flist and this is one thing I can help on.last year ( when I was a freshman ) I was concerned about showers/bathrooms staying clean !	0
I do n't need immaculate but it was important to me to have it sanitary .	0
a little reassurance about that would be good .	0
also , make sure all policies about bathrooms ( if there are any ) , visitors , getting furniture repaired , basic yet useful stuff like that , is very clear from the beginning .	1
I know you 're probably supposed to state it , but if you can , emphasize the we ( the residents ) ARE going to want to know these things .	0
I liked my RA because she sent really good emails .	1
She did n't just copy and paste in info or messages , but started out with nice words about whatever time of the semester it was and then got to the purpose of writing .	0
she also would say hello sometimes , ask how we were doing , but I never felt like I was being detained when I was trying to get something else done ( like walking by and getting sucked in ... which is a common dorm problem in general .	0
) probably the worst thing that happened on my hall last year was that people were constantly getting their food stolen from the fridge .	0
I really do n't know what the RA could have done about that , but it was very irritating , and brought about many passive-aggressive notes stuck on fridge with magnets.this year my main concerns are structural ( size of room , will the stairs make me tired , where is the kitchen , TV , laundry etc . )	0
and not related to RAs that I can figure.I hope you and your residents have a great year !	0
Thanks for this !	0
My first residents move in Monday , so you 're in time .	1
I do not think it means what you think it means.Okay , Internet , here 's the deal : it 's not a meme if you 're asking people to do it .	1
The whole point of the concept of a meme is that it was intended to describe the ispontaneous/i spread of ideas and phenomena as if they were diseases or viruses that infect people unbidden .	0
Let 's just make it an acronym !	0
`` Deliberate Internet Meme '' = DIM !	0
Actually , I think a deliberate Internet meme should be called a `` youyou ''	0
guys guys , let 's just pretend we 're using the french word meme which simply means `` THE SAME '' good enough ?	0
As language is fairly liquid the new conventional understanding of meme might in fact be a stronger meme than a ( n ) lj post de jour..	0
i guess words ca n't grow and change with use , huh ben ?	0
oooooooh.so what you 're saying is the first batgirl thing WAS a meme , but all the things that get passed around where you tag folks are NOT memes ?	0
even though that 's what everybody calls them ? i mean , the best i can see you hoping for here is dual definitions , man .	0
PS , your ACTUAL definition is of course way cooler than the one that is being created via internet confusion .	0
Well , I actually do n't much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly .	1
In its stronger forms , meme theory suggests that there 's no such thing as human consciousness or thought because our brains are just spongy , meme-infested piles of goop .	0
And if you do n't agree it 's only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one.But , anyway , yeah .	0
I think if you set out by saying , `` Hey guys , I am starting this new meme , '' then it is definitely not a meme .	0
It 's like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they `` caught '' it .	0
If there is such a thing as memes ( and the theory 's proponents say that they are things ) , then this is the meme equivalent of engineering weapons-grade strains of the Bird Flu .	0
Marry me .	0
Hello !	0
How are you ?	0
Sorry , just a very enthusiastic reaction to linguistic accuracy.Plus I sometimes hate those damn things .	0
No need to be sorry .	0
When used correctly , words are neat !	0
Ben , that 's so IRONIC because I was just thinking about this VERY UNIQUE idea and then you just posted about it , it 's so RANDOM !	0
I was LITERALLY rofl !	0
Seriously , then we need a new word for `` deliberate internet meme '' that people can start using .	0

Dan Hiller ?	0
Pretty cool .	0
I highly recommend his stuff ! ^_^	0
a is such a bad idea .	0
Even if every state has this , that 's still 50 individuals who think they 're in charge .	0
If you make one national organization , there 's ONE person who thinks he 's in charge .	0
One person who can become a power-hungry maniac and screw over everyone .	0
I mean , I agree that it 's not ias bad/i of an idea as a centralized federal agency .	0
The point is just that there already exist a bunch of federally funded agencies devoted to domestic intelligence gathering .	0
Well , yeah , and the NSA too .	0
Still , domestic intelligence ?	0
That there is even a need for that implies that people are n't happy with the government .	0
The essence of the social contract is that if people are n't happy , the government should change -- not that the government should try to gather intelligence to increase its power over them .	0
Creeeeeeeepy .	1
Almost as creepy as that Bachman woman saying that we need to investigate all of Congress to determine who 's `` pro-American '' and who 's `` anti-American . ''	0
a id= '' 1 '' > Why , Sen. McCarthy , I did n't recognize you in the form of a congresswoman of Minnesota .	0
Horrible to see your policies of fear mongering and paranoia are alive and well in our times .	0
Now would be a good time for folks to send a few dollars to Bachmann 's a who seems like a good guy , even aside from the fact that he 's most emphatically not Michele Bachmann .	0
Hell , I would vote for that guy based on his name .	0
Tinklenberg ?	0
Sign me up ! But seriously ... the country is moving closer and closer back to McCarthyism .	1
This crazy Bachman bitch is preaching it , and that article about a domestic intelligence agency sounds like the same thing to me .	0
span class='ljedittime'emEdited at 2008-10-21 03:16 pm UTC/em/span	0
I thought this was the FBI 's job ?	0
I 'm still not clear on how domestic investigation does n't automatically get included in that .	0
Yeah , exactly .	0
And the NSA 's .	0
It 's really covered quite well .	0
Hey , I could go work for the new agency if they start it !	0
( Not !	0
) Why do you think it 's such a bad idea ?	0
I have my reasons , but wonder why you take umbrage .	0
Unnecessary .	0
We already have FBI and NSA .	0
Liable to be misused .	1
Like the CIA , when the CIA is used within our borders ( and frequently without , too ) .	0
For use on Americans ?	0
Really ?	0
What 's the cause ?	0
Did the Unabomber warrant this ?	0
There 's simply no evidence to suggest such a thing is necessary .	0
The resources are better spent on more cops for rough cities , among other things .	1
40 or so people die from gun violence every day in America , which adds up to be way more than are killed by terrorism pretty quickly .	0
5. Who gets oversight ?	0
I assume the Executive , and the Exec already has ENOUGH power -- much more than the Constitution specifies .	0
It pretty much already exists , in the form of a Centers a source ) .	0
The existing intelligence fusion s are [ theoretically/technically/kinda ] state institutions rather than a centralized federal one , but they 're funded by federal grants , accountable to federal oversight , and several of them ( if not all - we 're not sure yet ) are required to share the intelligence they gather with federal agencies.span class='ljedittime'emEdited at 2008-10-23 03:28 pm UTC/em/span	0

p align= '' '' a http : /licemeichi.comortfolio/014-churchstate.html '' http : /licemeichi.comortfolio/014-churchstate-big.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' p align= '' left '' I painted this illustration as a way of expressing my frustration at the way America has been heading in recent years.In spite of the incredible step forward recently in the election of Barack Obama , the passing of Proposition 8 shows that we have a long way to go as a nation .	0
In recent years more than ever , right-wing politics has brought religion into the equation -- an exercise that casts incredible aspersions on the very foundations of this nation .	1
One of the first cornerstones of America called for the separation of Church and State , and yet issues such as abortion and gay rights have absolutely no redeeming features in a secular context .	0
How have we , as citizens in this Land of the Free , come to spit in the face of our Founding Fathers ?	0
They , above all , knew that religion pollutes politics and vice versa.Christians do n't deny Atheists any rights , and Atheism goes against the First Commandment .	0
Why should they deny any rights to homosexuals from a few verses in the Bible ?	1
Live , and let fucking live .	0
Thank you .	0
: ) : :Hugs back : :	0
The variety of `` Christian '' that would go around trying to codify the exclusivity of their beliefs into law has no more respect for atheists than it does for gays .	0
Christianist lawmaking harms both the law and Christianity .	0
That 's very true , but they have n't tried to take any civil liberties away from Atheists ( yet ) ... I remember back when I was a Junior in high school , my Christian Doctrine teacher passed these pamphlets out that called for a proposition which took away ALL civil rights from gays .	0
: / And named ridiculous reasons , such as how gays make a higher income than heterosexuals or whatever to incite jealousy/bitterness .	0
When he asked for the pamphlets back to pass around to the next class , I stood up and tore my copy up in front of him .	0
A few people applauded , but most started spreading `` rumors '' that I was gay .	0
The passage of these measures reflects a conservative majority , however slim that is .	0
What happened to the Senate , however , shows that Republicans lost seats despite social conservatives having a larger majority of this year 's vote .	0
( California and Florida both voted Obama .	0
) So , it actually shows that , at least in this election , running on a socially conservative platform was not enough to win the votes .	1
People have spoken for a change in their elected government but voted conservatively on other issues .	1
Two steps foward , one step back .	0
Still a long ways for us to go , indeed .	0
The problem , as I see it , is that people still vote for selfish interests rather than trying to protect their fellow citizens and their rights .	1
It 's the difference between a millionaire voting Democrat because they figure they could stand to lose a couple thousand a year for the good of the economy or voting Republican because they want to keep their private jet running .	0
: /Those who voted for Prop 8 either voted out of fear/discrimination of homosexuals or because they were following what their church told them like sheep .	0
Never once has it entered their mind that they might be wrecking their fellow Americans ' lives .	0
Oddly enough , our fcked up state passed Prop 2 , which mandates that farm animals have adequate room to move around , stretch , etc .	0
Yet , we 're denying gay folks who have no choice in who they are the rights granted to `` normal '' people .	0
Every time I saw a pro-Prop8 sign , it made me livid .	0
They claimed that a yes vote would protect children in schools , promote equality , and protect marriage .	0
It 's so misleading when the pro-8 people had signs that had a website called `` www.protectmarriage.org .	1
`` The entirety of prop 8 is this : '' Section 1 : TitleThis measure shall be known and may be sited as the `` California Marriage Protection Act .	0
`` Section 2 : Section 7.5 is added to Article I of the California Constitution to read : Section 7.5 Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California .	0
`` Since where does it say that a no vote will force children to know about same-sex marriage , destroy families , and lead to disintegrating morals ?	0
This is nearly a definition clause in the constitution .	0
When idiots start treating this stuff like the elastic clause , you know we 're screwed when people start believing in the bullshit they spew out.When I looked at the vote breakdown by race , whites were slightly in disfavor , hispanics were slightly in favor , and blacks were strongly in favor of Prop 8.While California overwhelmingly voted for Obama , Obama also did not support passage of Prop 8 , despite supposed distaste for gay marriage .	0
Of all people that I would have hoped to understand the plight of the repressed minority , I thought the African-American community would have understood .	0
But alas , they do n't learn from their lessons ( or maybe they have and would rather be the people that continue the cycle ) .So in conclusion , California would rather give rights to animals , and take them away from gays .	1
The only real social highlights I would consider reasonable was the rejection of the parental notification of a minor 's abortion .	1
Not everyone lives in a supportive and happy-go-lucky family , and I 'm glad it did n't pass.But if nothing else , we 'll get that high speed rail that joins San Francisco with San Diego .	0
Even if it is expensive , at least it 'll provide jobs and a really cool engineering marvel that the other industrialized countries enjoy now .	0
iI thought the African-American community would have understood .	0
But alas , they do n't learn from their lessons ( or maybe they have and would rather be the people that continue the cycle ) .	0
I do n't think it 's fair to place the blame on African-Americans as a culture for this .	1
a id= '' 12 '' > The blame is squarely on religion .	0
After all , it was the Mormons who heavily funded Prop 8 .	0
Of course , there were black people who voted due to religion and there is no excuse for that .	0
My point is that we should n't turn to just one race as a scapegoat .	0
I understand that their religion played the biggest part in it .	0
Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure .	0
I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50/50 .	0
Turns out it was the other way around .	0
But let 's assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated .	0
We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote .	0
Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most.I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue did n't see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage .	0
( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . )	0
CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it does n't excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage .	0
Yep , that 's exactly what I 'm saying .	0
There 's been a lot of race-baiting going on lately , and I just wanted to assuage that .	0
But ... but ...	0
THINK OF THE CHILDREN ! ! !	0
You mean , the children who have to grow up with gay polygamous parents who indulge in bestiality ? ? ?	0
OH NOES .	0
Yep ... those would be the ones .	0
... as if their happiness is harmful .	1
It 's not .	0
it amazes me how much effort these people put into breaking up innocent people 's lifestyles over - what ?	0
it if it 's also disgust ?	0
just `` looks bad '' ?	0
I think some straight couples disgust me too !	0
Would that count ? -- -Great illustration .	0
Brainzzzz .	0
Melting .	0
Perfect .	0
Seriously -- the reason Separation of Church and state was brought about was to protect the citizens ' practice of religion ... be it Christianity , Judaisim , Islam , Buddism , Hinduism , etc ... Why should one religion have more legislative influence than any other ?	1

But it is n't any more hopeless than most of the rest of the world .	1
It is n't like these people and their agenda only exists within the borders of the US or that it 's an American idea and Americans mean to take over the world starting with their own country .	0
After all , it 's a New World Order they 're aiming for .	0
A One World Government .	0
It 's where the European Union and the United Nations came from .	0
And where the American Union will come from .	0
They 've just infiltrated the United States government .	0
Living anywhere corporations control large portions of the government and the country 's infrastructure ( let alone legal system and military ) is as bad as anywhere else it happens .	0
Living under the control of power-mad elitist pieces of asshole shit anywhere is terrible .	0
Some are just more blatant and short-term about their despotic megalomania .	0
You 'd probably have to travel far less distance , if you 'd have to travel at all , in order to live in a place just as corrupted as the US has become .	0
It is n't hopeless anywhere in the world .	0
But it 's a hell of a climb out of the grave they 're making us think we 're digging ourselves .	0
See , this is why you have to move to Canuckistan .	0

this weekend i 'll have this : a pentax digital slr .	0
i have been told it is the worst brand camera to get .	0
but i 'm ignoring this advice and getting it anyway .	0
oh and a nice 28-300mm tamron lens .	0
oh and a remote .	0
i mean who wants to read about my life , it 's boring ... it 's only just about the pictures .	0
so i 'll give you pictures alright .	0
*shakes fist*to pay for it , i 'm selling a apple cinema display .	0
let me tell you , it 's a damn good buy.so i 'm off to wait for my camera and snap , snap .	0
I mean , I do really like the pictures because I 'm more visually oriented , and I am happy that you 'll be posting more photos , but I like to read about your life too .	0
It 's all about balance ! I 'll second the Canon recommendation ( and I 'm a Nikon guy ) .	0
If you 're going to buy into a DSLR system , I think Canon 's is the best one out there .	1
If you only ever plan to get the one lens , then it 's not a huge deal I suppose , but if you plan on getting a variety of lenses that you 'll be using for a number of years , then you want to go with a camera company that 's going to be around .	0
youre selling an ACD to get a pentax ? thats topsy turvy.more ppl masturbate over camera performances than they do taking photos.i guarantee there are more shit photogs around than shit dslrs.ie its the photographer not the camera that makes it a good 'photo '	0
Well said , yawningpenis .	0
A good photographer can do awesome work with a polaroid or 'phonecam .	1
Many people ( who own them ) could n't take a good picture with £2500 worth of camera equipment .	0
well i have a 17 '' PowerBook and 15 '' MBP , so the 20 '' display is just too small .	0
i may invest in the 23 '' to make having one worth while.did you get your FB dimms for the MacPro ?	0
im not goign to ask why you have a 17 and a 15 mac laptop.im assuming you wanted the intel chip ... i got them a few weeks ago from OWC.and by bluetooth module is on its way.massdebating about the ati x1900xt for aperture ...	0
my bf got a canon 400D the other day but i have no idea about that sort of stuff so really , this is a pointless comment : P	0
well the 400d is ... errr.. something i would 've wish i could 've got : P	0
Well I always like to read about your life , so I hope you still find time to write about it : ) You 're a very talented photographer , but I shall be hoping for some words here and there too : )	0
I 'm trying to think of a way to say do n't get Pentax without sounding desperate but.. eh .	0
For the love of GOD , do n't get Pentax .	1
If you 're after an entry level DSLR go Canon .	0
Get a 350D , or even a 400D .	0
why , what 's the reason ?	0
Canon provide an overall better photography system , from body to sensor to optics ( canon Lseries lenses are something out of this world ) .	0
I ca n't tell which model Pentax that is in particular , but at the very least it has a CCD , rather than CMOS sensor , and wo n't be more than 6.1 MP .	0
If you do go for pentax , I would advise from experience that you get an extended gaurentee.Globally they do have a record of not being the best for the price and very fragile .	1
They are not the worst you can get , but they are not far off it .	0
Pentax have tried to enter the digital market without really looking at what a camera needs to be worth having , and until they come up with soething far better than what I have used and seen from them so far , I would avoid spending money on one.andlt ; 333	0
well the pentax is n't going to be a huge step for me .	0
i just sold out and got it because i just do n't have the money to spend on getting a canon - and have it for the sake of having an slr .	0
i 'll have to stick to my canon film slr until in a few years i can afford to upgrade again : )	0
oh yes , i got the extended 3 year warranty for it too !	0
Very pleades to hear that .	0
I hope it is not needed , but you will be so glad you have got it if it does break like many before it has.andlt ; 333	0
I am sure you will do well with it.Just try to look after it , I enjoy your images as much as I enjoy your words , and together they are complete works of art.I wish I were in a position to pay the difference between the pentax and a great cannon , but we both know I am in as bad a situation you are.andlt ; 333	0

Some other opinions of the Other Annie Proulx Movie® : a title= '' Didnand # 39 ; t care for it '' target= '' _blank '' Eherensteinland , a title= '' Didnand # 39 ; t care for it AT ALL '' target= '' _blank '' David Ehrenstein at HuffingtonPost , and Adam Mars-Jones at a title= '' Not fond of it either '' target= '' _blank '' Guardian Unlimited.br For the record : I have n't seen it , so I really have no opinion as of yet ; however I 'm probably gon na wait on this one -- I 'm just not a fan of Westerns . Even though its really a movie about sheepherders . Technically .	0
You make some excellent points - but my core ion ( perhaps I 'm not expressing myself well ) is very simple .	0
Leaving the argument about the words `` gay '' or `` love '' out of this , clearly there 's supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about `` a force of nature '' in the advertising for the movie .	0
What does that `` force '' accomplish in the story ? Nada .	0
Zip .	0
Zilch .	0
Nothing.To me , that makes no sense ; passion drives people to strive for things , even if they fail .	0
Jim Henson 's passion for his work gave us the Muppets , characters that millions of people love .	0
Ian Anderson 's passion for music has given us some incredible albums .	0
Passionate architects gave us buildings like the Eiffel Tower , the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building .	0
Passion drove Van Gogh to ruin - while leaving amazing paintings in its wake.Perhaps there 's some personalization sneaking in here - I may not be entirely ive .	0
But my main ion to the story seems to me to be this basic structural element - passion is a dynamic , driving force and in iBrokeback Mountain/i it just ... does nothing .	0
I hear you more clearly .	0
I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless .	1
It 's not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere .	0
BUT sex , or to holding myself in.In a sense , what the movie gets `` right '' for me happens most clearly with Ennis 's character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free .	0
And he does fail to contain himself in many ways ... but what 's tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling.Does that make any sense ? Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I 've had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years .	0
Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self.Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that 's the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you *don't* learn and apply that lesson.The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of `` right . ''	0
Problem is , having lived through that myself , as I say , I 'm not sure it 's a story I really needed to sit through again .	0

And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as andquot ; bitter.andquot ; andgt ; andgt ; ... which is all part of the process .	0
You support the art that is even only halfway there , to encourage more and more process .	0
Perfection is a damn near impossible task to conquer -- but can be a breathlessly wonderful/frustrating/fulfilling *process* to try and attain.Hype is hype is hype and it is part of the modern business of filmrt/music/whatever , so you choose to deal with it or not .	0
I , for one , donand # 39 ; t allow it to affect my end enjoyment ( or dislike ) of something./div/div	0
ithe hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE/iTaken literally , that 's a pretty weird statement .	0
What 's so hard about ignoring it ?	0
How many people are going on about it in their blogs ?	0
Hell , the magazine I work for had the movie as a cover story .	0
Unless I want to cut off a sizable chunk of the people I subscribe to on LJ and take other similarly drastic measures , it would be nearly impossible to avoid .	0
Perhaps I went a bit over the top with `` intolerable '' but it really is being extremely annoying .	0
For me , it 's been the weird sense of dislocation as people with whom I 'm usually simpatico started waiting breathlessly for something that , as far as I could see , looked apt to be problematic .	0
I 've been glad to discover that the film is LESS problematic than I worried it would be.Queer men spend lots of time feeling like outsiders ; I think when we notice that we 're varying in our reactions to something specifically about us , we feel that outsiderhood all the more sharply .	0
Feeling like a minority within the minority is tough .	0
Sorry , but this David guy sounds like a bitter , jaded queen who seems bent on impressing the reader with how many obscure gay-movie references he can cough up .	0
FEH !	0
Perhaps , but he 's also quite right.I have inever/i understood the furor over this tawdry little story ; it 's tedious , it 's depressing and ultimately unnecessary .	1
Yeah , yeah , yeah , it was the '60s before Stonewall - bso fucking WHAT ?	0
! /b If there 's this massive `` passion '' between these two characters something should ihappen/i with it -- people throughout history have risked worse for lust and love.As a chronicle of how many people with gay/bi tendencies have been stunted by societal expectations , it 's great .	0
The one thing it 's not is a love story - which is how the blind masses singing its praises describe it .	1
To borrow from a radically different genre , I grab two words from the world of iBabylon 5/i - bFAITH uMANAGES/u./b I 've always believed in the definition of love as `` the state where someone else 's well-being means more to you than your own '' - and that definition clearly does NOT hold in this story.You wan na talk about social pressure ?	0
It seems like if one states publically an opinion like mine , it 's near to instant pariah-hood that one is n't worshipping at the altar of this unctious little travesty .	0
I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein -- he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear .	0
wAnd while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the `` ivory tower '' .	1
That is the big problem with blowhards like them -- they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men ... therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them .	0
They are happy to be urban -- and urbane -- '' queers '' of 2005 , and they never presume to `` lower themselves '' to understand lives that are different from their own ...	0
very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population ...	1
as `` W '' has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life .	0
It 's one thing to not understand what you 've never experienced , it 's another thing entirely to disdain what you do n't understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over .	0
And that does n't even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 's .	0
The story of `` Brokeback Mountain '' is sparse ... that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his/her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --	1
not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says `` Oh , Bob -- I LOVE YOU ! `` and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying `` THIS IS A LOVE STORY ... YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . ''	0
You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L.A. or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story ... and if you 've never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die ... then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story .	0
It 's a love story alright ... but it 's a tragedy , too ... passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that ca n't be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love .	0
But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted ... and depression , too .	1
We see a hell of a lot of that still , judging by the number of gay and bi men who are on anti-depressants and in therapy .	0
The story IS depressing and cathartic , yet very necessary -- it 's about US , even if we have n't lived through all the experiences of the characters ourselves .	0
By your logic , the only people who can `` legitimately '' comment on the story/movie are bi shepherds who 've spent a lot of time out in the middle of nowhere with a flock.I grant you there 's a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there 's also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just do n't want to deal with .	0
I grew up in semi-rural Oregon - no , not WAY out in the middle of nowhere , but far , far from being a `` big city . ''	0
I stand by what I 've said about the story and the movie .	0
No , you do n't need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to `` legitimately '' comment on it ... for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation .	1
If you ca n't put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my `` logic '' , then the storyline will hold nothing for you ... and that would be unfortunate .	0
Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my `` thing '' for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship ... she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad ... I do n't have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one ... I 've had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it 's awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others .	0
As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life 's difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not.Some people have issues with the story ... others do n't want to deal with the hype about it ... .others see something to it ... and all points of view are fine .	0
I have issues with `` film critics '' who insert their own visions of what they believe is `` proper sociology '' -- whether it 's a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances .	0
I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-ed hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors .	0
And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of `` holding court '' .	0
People pushing back is not making you a pariah ... it 's saying that many of us see value that you do n't wish to see , and that many of us see love as a LOT more than just valuing someone else 's well-being more than your own ... or having a rough fuck .	0
It 's OK that you disagree , but your disagreement does n't make conflicting points of view any less valid than your own ... and the impression you give is that you take offense because people disagree with you .	0
Well this time you beat me to the punch .	0
You said exactly what I had in mind .	0
I hope that Furr reads and understands your last point .	0
Note that I 'm talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours.What I take offense at is the suggestion there 's something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . )	0
I take offense at the insinuation that I 'm some kind of traitor to the `` Gay Cause '' for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE.Whether or not the word `` love '' gets used or not , clearly there 's supposedly ipassion/i in the story ... but what does it do ?	1
It 's like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers .	0
Passion imoves/i fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties .	0
This story just kind of staggers around for a while then falls over .	0
And no , the story need n't have a `` happy ending '' in order to be satisfying .	0
How would I change the story ?	0
Hmm ... let me think.Our two shepherds ( a ) never enter into pointless marriages , realizing ( if only internally ) that this ca n't possibly match the level of passion they 've shared .	0
They manage to scrape together the money for their own ranch , and indeed have a period of some happiness together , during which they wind up shooting to death a couple shitheads who come to their spread with the intent of killing our protagonists - in circumstances that make it clear it was self defense .	0
After some time of being excruciatingly careful , one of the two winds up being ambushed , his partner arriving just that much too late , and the one dies in the other 's arms .	0
The survivor puts the property up for sale , and vanishes into the sunset ... .OK , so I 'm throwing in some cliches here as shorthand , but the point is all that passion drives them TO something .	0
You can still have all the societal disapproval ( once it turns out they 're not JUST business partners ... ) and the brutal death , etc .	0
and so on .	0
I do n't recall the characters in the story being portrayed as being particularly dim , so I find it difficult to believe that EVEN in the given setting , it 's impossible for them to conceive of a way to be together that would slip under the radar , or behind the common presumptions of the time , at least for a while .	0
They do n't have to be `` gay '' , they just have to NOT be utterly fucking STUPID.I 'm no stranger to holding a minority opinion in a variety of fields , but it 's been rare that I 've gotten this much personal hostility over openly stating I dislike a particular story , and that I ca n't for the life of me understand why people are cumming all over themselves about it .	0
I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something said earlier in this thread	1
`` The story ... is sparse ... that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his/her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself .	0
`` I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it 's feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we 've been through that feels similar and was painful at the time.To me , it 's the film 's biggest strength AND greatest weakness.I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how `` this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , '' and I was saying , `` Well , yes , I 'm sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we should n't overpersonalize this .	0
`` I mean , I actually did live in Wyoming in the late 1980s , a few years after this film ends .	0
When I had orientation at my Air Force base in Cheyenne , they warned us not to talk about our jobs out with strangers out at the bars , because some of the strangers were KGB agents .	0
They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver.Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like `` gay '' and concepts like `` gay bar , '' even if they were two hours away and sounded scary .	0
I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women ... but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options .	0
Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us.Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and did n't even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone.If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world has n't changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better .	0
I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now .	0
And like I 'm ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days.I agree that it 's not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else .	1
It just means we have dreams and needs that ca n't always get met right now .	0
Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams.I also have to say , I 'm always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other `` jaded queens '' over their disagreements .	0
I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I 've seen it ... but I was n't jaded because I 'm just some cynical , bitter queen : I 'm jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film .	0
And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as `` bitter .	0
`` Maybe we would get further if we all honored each other 's hopes , dreams , and hurts , even if they lead us to different conclusions about a half-full/half-empty work of art like this one .	0
I just started playing this old NES RPG called a And man , those old school RPGs are really hard to play .	1
I do n't mean that it 's especially challenging to accomplish the goals set out for the player .	0
I mean it 's actually difficult to navigate the clunky , antiquated interface that was the standard when RPGs were a new thing .	0
Game 's still fun , though .	0
Oh man , I got halfway through that game without realizing there was equipment that I pretty much needed to buy in Magicant and the battles got impossibly hard .	0
There was no way I could just go back to Magicant , either .	0
It sucked .	1
I could n't play anymore .	0
I 'm kind of cheating .	1
I 'm playing the `` easy '' mod , where every battle gives you double EXP and money .	0
The most frustrating thing about that game , to me , is that the random encounters are literally random .	1
In more modern RPGs the `` random '' encounters are calculated in a such a way that they 're spaced out a bit , though not by a specific amount .	0
It keeps the appearance of enemies steady , but unpredictable and less tedious .	0
In Mother , I 've had periods where I get an enemy every single step , and others where I do n't see any enemies for two minutes .	0
Yeah , it 's a little messed up .	0

I fucking love IHOP .	1
I will never understand why there are people in the world who do n't - it 's the INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF FUCKING PANCAKES , everyone .	0
Does that not mean ianything/i to you ? I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) .	0
So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette .	0
Sometimes the I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries.I just got a call from my mother two minutes ago : I 'm on my way home from work and I 'm about to pass by IHOP .	0
What do you want ? I want twelve pancakes and a pound of bacon .	0
Also , for everyone to know my mommy is amazing .	0
I finally decided on Nutella crepes and a Ham and Swiss melt with a side of onion rings .	0

Y'know what offends me more than overtly sexist jerks ?	1
More than the Feminist Orthodoxy Police ?	0
Possibly even more than bad scholarship , logical fallacies , and poor reasoning , though there was enough of those involved as well that it 's hard to be certain.It 's men who use feminism as a camouflage , or even a justification , for their own sexist entitlement .	0
When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like `` sexist entitlement '' and `` male privilege '' .	0
Nope , I 'm definitely inot/i a Fun Feminist when it comes to that .	0
I 've just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of `` feminist ally '' , a Knight in Shining Armor .	0
I 'd like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed.A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he 'd never usurp our movement - this one favors `` radical pro-feminist '' ) who is involved with feminism because he 's Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind .	0
( Pause in composition ; I just had a brilliantly apropos icon idea and imust/i do it right this instant ... and , done , loaded , applied to entry .	0
) I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains ifor/i me .	0
As I 've already mentioned , I 'm down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I 'm very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors .	0
( And when we get back to the barracks ... um , never mind . )	0
But fight the fight ifor/i me ?	0
Not friggin ' likely .	0
So - you can see Sir Lancelot a action at Derek 's a Feminism - inot/i Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task .	0
Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( 'bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there 's little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it 'll penetrate his +4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you do n't think he iwon't/i sneak back to see how we took it ?	0
) , and it 'll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you 're so inclined ) .	0
Anyway , it would n't be courteous to Derek .	0
And , since I 'm going to mention over there that I 've snarked about it here , with link , chances are we 'll have a meal of Silly Knigget deliver itself right to my doorstep - dinner 's on me !	0
( Comment policy for that is , mock at will , but avoid flaming .	0
) Sir Knigget is not without utility ; he not only contributed greatly to clarifying my thinking regarding that discussion , he also shed some light on the complex tangle of my feminism .	1
i '' I 'm much clearer on what 's problematic about # 5 : it subtly assumes that a woman , at any rate a pregnant woman , bneeds/b a man , and glosses over the injustices that bcreate/b that need .	0
Obliging men to ante up bdoes nothing whatsoever/b to address those injustices ; it seeks only to alleviate them .	0
`` /i - SunflowerIf I 'm reading my feminist history aright , that 's right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself .	1
( I invite corrections , clarifications , etc , from my more learned readers . )	0
Old-school radical feminism , or so I understand , largely examined paradigms through collectivist-socialist , or even outright Marxist , lenses , while I 'm cut [ changes metaphors in midstream ] from rather different cloth ( though the fabric still has a left bias - `` individualist-socialist '' might describe it ) .	0
Nevertheless , if I 've parsed this right , I 'm more radical than not .	0
( Certainly I have a good many ideas that some feminists , many of whom identify as radfem , consider `` radical '' in the pejorative sense , but that 's another can of worms .	0
) I 'm discovering something very interesting about feminist discourse : if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it .	1
I suspect this has to do with a keyboard-interface-related mental trigger - certainly my phrasings , and I 'm pretty sure my debative skills and tactics , become sharper and more precise , when I 'm resisting the temptation to descend into ad hominem arson ( `` I may be a skunk , but you 're a piece of junk .	0
And furthermore , I do n't like your trousers .	0
Or your appalling taste in women .	0
And what about your mind ?	0
Your insipid record collection ; your down-home video centre - the usual pornography ... '' - Pretenders , iPretenders II/i , `` Pack It Up '' ) .	0
Not that I do n't also learn lots in more pleasurable circumstances , but there 's something about cutting the heart out of some asshat 's argument with surgical precision and offering it to the Morrigan , all without overstepping the bounds of legitimate debate , that causes me to learn things about myself ( other than that I have a tongue like a scalpel , a taste for blood , and the quintessential feminist trait of Wo n't Shut Up ; that 's not news ) .	0
And there 's nothing like some good snark to relieve any leftover pressure .	0
I feel much better now .	0
Comes right down to it , I have to agree with you - the opt-out can only work if it does n't leave the mothers high and dry .	0
But I 'm also concerned with the other ways - not necessarily directly related to cash flow - that single moms often get hung out to dry .	0
And that leads into other injustices , that affect more than just single moms .	0
Complex stuff.You could be right about context failure ; he did seem to have a lot of `` regurgitate the party line '' going on.Actually , I was thinking of your ability to call ime/i on things , if I need it .	0
But , yeah , I do n't call everybody on everything - life 's too short .	0
Which is why I stuck mostly to calling buddy on the underlying sexism in how he was participating - refutation of his arguments just did n't seem to have enough of a constructive return , either for the debate as it was shaping before he came along , or for me .	0
I 'm actually not sure about this issue .	0
I know two men whose girlfriends assured them that they were on birth control and would get an abortion if it failed , then promptly presented the guys with a blue stick and a sudden conversion to pro-life .	0
Now the guys have to choose between unplanned marriage or a serious financial burden.Both of the girls were teenagers and their intentions , as far as I could tell , were to secure marriage and thus Twu Wuv.I do n't know an entirely good solution though .	0
Obviously you ca n't allow men to dictate whether or not women abort or give up the pregnancy .	0
( On the flip side , I also know some men who 've been devastated by their girlfriends having abortions -- and going `` tough noogies sperm donor , you do n't own her '' is just not the answer I can give a close friend who 's grieving because he thought he would be a father . )	0
And allowing men to skip out entirely on responsibility for their offspring leaves single moms in the lurch .	0
But the idea of someone being forced to be a father does n't make me happy either.Dammit .	0
Men and women can iboth/i be horrifyingly dishonest in this arena .	0
The only good solution is for both partners to participate in birth control , but when that does n't happen ...	0
I just do n't know.No , a pregnant woman does n't need a man , but she kinda does need ( or at least massively benefit from ) the time and money contributions of a second person.Argh .	0
The fundamental problem is that babies only grow in women .	0
I just ca n't think of a pat and equitable solution under that constraint.Sorry this comment does n't make sense ; I am inot/i at all sure what type of feminist I am or what my opinions are on all issues .	0
It 's a bit stream-of-consciousness ( as the title warns ) , but there 's a good deal of sense in it .	0
Feminism is n't about knowing the answers , it 's about trying to find them.And you 're right about that fundamental problem .	1
There are feminist theorists who have posited that full equality will only be possible when all babies are grown iin vitro/i - a stance that at least proposes a solution , rather than shaking its fist at the slings and arrows of outrageous biology , but ... well , rather than writing yet another essay in a comment , I 'll just say I find it extreme .	0
Sunflower , you were in Canada when you had your babies , yes ?	0
Because as jfpbookworm points out , the supports are awfully thin here in the U.S . The only reason men get stuck with child support is that society as a whole is n't willing to support children of single parents .	1
At least in Canada , you 're covered for health care .	0
( Here , too , in theory , but there are holes in the CHIPS program .	0
) In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U.S. - people are less delusional about sex and birth control .	0
But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized .	0
The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one 's benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones .	0
( Germany 's public daycare system is also being slowly de-funded .	0
) I 'm not sure I 'd sign on to the Marxist part of your definition of radical feminist .	1
That only describes a fraction of the overall group .	0
But what I really appreciate is that you put a definition out there that lets us know what you mean .	0
Yup , I 've been talking about the `` different jurisdictions , different conditions '' thing all along ( and was pleased to read your German example - I know very little about how it works in countries other than Canada and the US ) .	1
I do n't consider `` Marxist '' to be part of the definition , nor even `` collectivist-socialist '' - that bit was more a reflection on how , and in what part of the zeitgeist of the times , radical feminism did much of its developing .	0
The core of where I was going definitionally was the difference in approach - from my reading thus far , the question , `` by what means can we best achieve our goals ? ''	0
seems to be the main way in which `` schools '' of feminism split off from each other ( first-wave example : the suffragists and those who focused on equality in educational opportunities [ educationalists ? ?	0
] ) .	0
`` ( other than that I have a tongue like a scalpel , a taste for blood , and the quintessential feminist trait of Wo n't Shut Up ; that 's not news ) .	0
`` definately not news ... and am I ever so grateful that I 've not been on the receiving end of such surgery : andgt ; otherwise known as Nemmie the shy : P	0
See , now , that 's why `` scalpel '' and not , say , `` claymore '' .	0
I like to be precise in my targets .	1
I 'm better online ( where , if necessary , I can put the keyboard down and back away slowly ) than in person ; sometimes someone 'll get nipped for no greater crime than atrocious timing ( I seem to recall you 've been on the receiving end of that , but I do n't recall circumstances ) .But the idea is that surgery is for a ) otherwise intelligent and reasonable people who need to have some bit of WTF ? ! ?	0
called un-ignorably to their attention , and b ) out-and-out asshats .	0
You 're certainly not the latter ; and I do n't recall seeing you go all the way into WTF ? ! ?	0
territory .	0
neither do I for that matter ... but then my memory is a sieve lately.. : andgt ; I 'm pretty sure I 've been there.. : andgt ; at least my memory says I have , just not on the receiving end of your brand of surgery for it .	0
say ... . here 's an idea.. we should do coffee.. play catch up.. ( we 'll agree on a maximum of 3 topics for time allowances sake this time.. : P ) I 'll e-mail details if you prefer.. : andgt ;	0
I believe he is what is called a `` concern troll '' .	0
Very possibly , though I 'd guess he 's the unwitting sort of troll .	0
( I do n't altogether buy the `` true trolls know they 're trolls '' axiom . )	0
That kind of situation is what the phrase `` stop being on my side , you 're making my side look stupid '' was invented for .	0
And he is on my side , kind of ; my take on `` choice for men '' is that - at least here in the States - a lot of other social and legal changes need to be made first .	0
( I *think* we may be on the same page here , if I 'm reading your point about addressing `` injustices that create that need '' right . )	0
Taking up the flaming sword can be tempting .	0
But if we do , there 's an obligation to be careful where we point the thing .	1
It 's generally a bad idea to make one 's `` feminist '' argument at the expense of actual women 's experiences .	0
iif something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it./iThere are folks whose writing I read primarily for that purpose - though a fair chunk of the time , it 's my own argument that gets vivisected .	0
( This is a good thing - if I 've pissed someone off , I *want* to be called on it . )	0
I 'm pretty sure we 're at least close to the same page - it 's partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter 's father opt out .	1
( My son 's father did n't even get an opt-in ; he was ... not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody .	0
Kid won , of course . )	0
Mind you , Canada is n't perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I 'd have been in a much more precarious position if they were n't .	0
I 'm not so sure the KiSA iis/i on your side ; he did n't seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he 's convinced they 're immutable ; at worst , he 's got a hidden agenda .	1
I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up `` pregnancy is so dangerous '' ias an argument supporting mandatory support/i - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father 's involvement has ino effect/i on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) .	0
What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women would n't need men .	0
( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) .	0
) Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women 's experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal .	0
It 's not just an academic exercise in utopian philosophy ; real people , with diverse individual needs , will be living the changes we make.Oddly , I was n't talking so much about things that challenge my assumptions ( that works too , but it usually does n't make me nearly so angry ) - that would n't surprise me as much .	0
What I did n't expect is how educational it can be to confront an absence of intellectual rigor.I 'm glad you prefer to be called on things ; I have an unpopular habit of calling people on things .	0
And a confusing habit of wanting to be called on things ( doubly confusing , because that does n't mean I take it meekly ; I iengage/i it - or sometimes call people on presenting it manipulatively ) , so I hope you also have that unpopular habit .	0
What `` choice for men '' comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead .	1
I 'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there 's a sufficient support system in place so that the child 's mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to .	0
But right now we do n't have that .	0
Instead , we have conservative think tanks a that what little aid we do give costs too much .	0
I think the bringing up of `` pregnancy is so dangerous '' may simply have been a context failure .	1
I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as `` the feminist position . ''	0
But it 's not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent `` punishment '' to , pregnancy , and I do n't see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism .	0
And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation .	0
Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I 've heard them so many times before , that there 's no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout .	0
Is n't it funny how random little things can make you so cheerful ?	1
I picked up a nice drink shaker and martini glasses today for super cheap unexpectedly , and it 's just made the entire day even better than it already was .	0
So who wants to come over for cocktails ?	0
I 'd come , but the whole 'other continent ' thing gets in the way .	0
( although it does lead to humourous hittings of the öä keys instead of what I was going for , along with adds like the one in my icon ) Hope all is well with you ^_^	0
Things are well , thank you .	0
I hope they 're good for you too .	0
And yes , other continent = problems .	0
How are things with you ?	0

Um , I 'm always glad to have people over , but 1 ) you appear to live in Michigan and 2 ) I do n't know who you are .	0
Apart from that , how do you like Tahitian vanilla martinis ?	0

But , that whole opposite coast thing ... yeah .	0
Yeah , that IS problematic .	0
So is the fact that most of the people on my LJ are on that same coast with you .	0

I am so tired of hearing about this Cash for Clunkers bullshit Do n't people have any sense at all ?	1
The people who can afford to buy a new car even with the government rebate ... The cars they are turning in are not bad cars when it comes to gas milage .	0
They are the nicer used cars .	0
You do n't want to take the nicer used cars off the road ;	0
What are the lower income people going to drive ?	0
These are the cars they would have bought used .	0
Now they are going to be forced into driving even older cars .	0
You take all the nicer used cars off the road and destroy them ... You are not improving the enviorment .	0
You are just creating hardship for the lower income people .	1
And you are keeping the really really old cars on the road	0
Plus you are creating economic hardship for the lower income folks .	0
Seconds this .	0
, If I had to make a guess , most of the people turning in Clunkers are bringing in 10 year old cars .	0
Which adds up to many less 90s-2000 cars for those of us driving only used .	0

At least , wiki tells me it 's a hat , but it seems to be a french-canadian word.While I was n't technicolour , I ended up going home at about 3am last night , wondered right past my house and found some very large orange flattopped mushrooms .	0
This made me happy .	0
Nightcrawling in cities is a wonderful thing if it can be done with relative safety .	1

I love accidentally spouting local lingua , it 's almost like we have a cuisine ( which we do n't ) , except with words .	1

I used to make things called night bouquets which are pretty illegal ( or at least rude ) , where I 'd grab a flower from each storefront I passed until I had a bunch , and then I 'd gift it to someone who would look at it like um , okay..	0
I never found mushrooms though , which would be cool .	0

Most of it was stolen from India ( our national dish , in fact , is basically a curry ) , and while I love haggis it does n't really have international appeal .	0
Got to love the idea of night bouquets , as cheeky as they are .	0
Mushrooms are the really nice thing about Canturbury though , since this place is like a fusion between town and countryside , and you can find bits of both everywhere .	0

Still , it 's an awesome idea.Instead , we had to content ourselves today with visiting the hillside where St. Bernard preached the Second Crusade in 1146 before the assembled nobility of France and 100,000 pilgrims .	0

Jenn will always be willing to aid you in any fight for justice you need , even though all she can do is like ... fence with a broom handle.iLady : /i Jennifer only met Lady when she was deaged into Mary , and only for a brief while , but she thought Mary was an adorable sweetheart .	0
If she ever meets Lady , she will never connect the two of them ever.bHOT/NOT MEME/biGai : /i ... ... ... ... Jennifer is very certain that someday , you will find your Special Someone , Mister Sparkle .	0

*huuuuuugs* : ( Roxas is adorable and made of fail .	0
; _ ; I loved Xion so much more than I thought I would .	0
I knooooow .	0
I was very leery of Xion going in , because dude I 've seen this plot and it sucked when it was fanfic , but actually she is awesome and tragic and WOES .	0
Poor girl did n't deserve to be only kind of real and stuck in permanent power-drain mode and all.Also , I am very glad there was another boss battle with Saïx , because I needed to punch him in the face kind of a lot .	0
STOP CALLING HER AN IT RAWR .	0
Congratulations , you have created a living thing with not much in the way of memories !	0
That is not a 'puppet ' ; that is what we technically call a 'child ' .	0
Seriously , just because you were created by amateurs in an unsafe environment in such a way that you took years to develop properly does n't make you ibetter/i .	0
Maybe I 've been reading too many superhero comics , where heroic characters often are aliens/cloneslien clones/research projects/robotsll of the above , but I appear to have a much broader definition of `` person '' than Saïx or , for that matter , DiZ , whom I did n't get to beat up , which continues to depress .	0
The qualifying exam looks like this:1 .	0
Is someone answering this question ? If the answer is `` Yes '' , then you are a person .	0
If the answer is `` No '' , enjoy your logic bomb .	0
: ( I believed in her character , where that kind of thing would take really REALLY good fanfic to be convincing , yeah ?	0
Poor kids .	0
: ( All of him.XD After playing KH2 , I was n't sure why Saïx was so important that he merited 'boss before the boss ' status .	0
I mean sure , he 's pretty , but-Then I played 358 and I said 'oh'.He earned his status , and I applaud that .	0
:3 It still twits me a little that I did n't understand his position and therefore did n't give him enough credit in fic , but oh well ... .	0
I have this mental image of Saïx pulling a Menelaus in Axel 's direction .	0
`` IS THIS WHAT YOU LEFT ME FORRRRRRRRRRRRR ? `` Yeah .	0
: ( He and DiZ dehumanize what they plan to take advantage of .	0
On DiZ ' part- I think to keep Riku from letting his concience get the better of him , but Saix does n't really have a reason .	0
:3 He 'ca n't feel ' .	0
He should n't need to distance himself .	0
: DThat logic takes my brain to interesting places~ .	0
*wibble* Yes .	0
Saix , you ass- you 're a biproduct of humanity , just like a replica .	0
I feel the need to give Xion AUs full of hugs and kittens.Saïx deserves to be the penultimate boss both because you will hate him SO .	1
MUCH .	0
and also because he 's ... actually behind a lot more than it seems .	0
I kind of wonder how much iXemnas/i knew about Castle Oblivion , now .	0
Before this game , I was kind of thinking that Xemnas 's actions were suspicious , but seeing Saïx going around clearly being in charge -- and very invested in making sure no one challenges his control -- well , I wonder how carefully edited the reports that made it to Xemnas 's ears were.L-lol .	0
*smacks blonde wig on Axel*I think as far as DiZ is concerned , he is very smart but also in certain areas very dumb -- witness the fact that he did n't notice his apprentices were going to turn on him , when some of them ( cough Vexen cough ) are n't exactly subtle by nature .	1
So he gets all bitter and treats all Nobodies like they 're tarred with the same brush , totally ignoring the fact that Roxas , Xion , and Naminé especially are victims more than anything .	0
It 's annoying and dumb , but also very human.Saïx , on the other hand , is kind of a sociopath anyway .	0
Part of me sneakily suspects that he 'd refer to most people as 'it ' if he thought he could get away with it .	0
He treats everyone like puppets anyhow ... ( Jesus , no wonder he wanted Zexion gone gone gone .	0
Kilkenny cats have nothing on professional string-pullers when it comes to thinking two is too many .	0
) On a lighter note , Demyx was kind of adorable in his laziness .	0
I found my characterization of him confirmed -- so he 's not keen on fighting , but he has other skills .	0
Not least of which is the 'get Roxas to do my work ' skill .	0
Hi guys I am in Paris it is a city that 's about it except with different varieties of streetside food-stands so not that different from NYC really .	0
I do not believe in punctuation today it is too much effort and I am being stylistic it is fun .	0
Struggling with getting my computer to find the wireless at my host family .	0
Will post more when I have succeeded .	0
Also have no phone .	0
Working on that .	0
Do the French not believe in clocks ? !	0
This is absolutely the most annoying thing about France to date , possibly including the fact that the building where the program has orientation and classes and such has no indoor heating .	0
Oh whoops some punctuation snuck in there .	0
I have an hour commute which is all kinds of fun but the Metro is much like all subways and not too hard to get the hang of .	0
The computer I 'm using now has a French keyboard but it 's set up to actually send signals like an American one so I guess it 's a good thing I touch-type or I 'd be very confused.Love to all .	0
I am so jealous .	0
I would love to go to Paris/France someday.I hope you have a good time !	0
If being a French major is good for nothing else ( which it is n't ) , it is at least good for getting you to France on the cheap , because they reallyreallyireally/i want you to go , even if you do n't have what we technically call 'money ' .	1
Thanks !	0
It 's pretty okay so far !	0
How are periods , question marks , and bangs not punctuation ?	0

For the past two weeks , I have hung out at a coffee shop after an appointment , to have a snack and do some knitting .	0
Both times , I have had men chat me up .	0
Both times I thought to myself , Why are these old guys flirting with me ?	0
Then I realized that , in all likelihood , they are no more than 5 years older than me.I went home and shot space aliens on the Xbox like a proper 14-year-old boy and felt better .	0
The knitting must be some kind of magnet ...	0
Yeah , because it 's interruptable , I think .	1
I can talk and still do it , thus the chatting up .	0
And to be fair , if I answered in monosyllables , they 'd retreat .	0
The thing is , the conversations are interesting , it 's just the dog-at-the-dinner-table stare that puts me off.Dude , you are not just barking up the wrong tree , your mellow-yet-professional , probably New Age , yoga-teaching ass is barking up about three different wrong trees simultaneously .	0
Now pardon me while I go take some Ritalin and shoot things with my a gun.span class='ljedittime'emEdited at 2008-03-22 11:26 pm UTC/em/span	0
Alternate the snack eating and knitting with deep and methodic booger picking .	0
If this still fails to deflect the old dudes approach , just wipe said booger on their sleeves .	0
Or stick boogerfinger in their face and ask , Does this look infected ?	0
It smells infected.btw , at my new work is a cat named Bug who got a bunch of shots to be allowed into the country .	0
The shots ' side effect left him wobbly .	0
The wobbly cat makes me think of little Tim .	0
If only there was a way they could team up and fight crime .	1
The combined wobble and lickety-lickety would strike fear , no doubt .	0
I told my mom this and she thought it was hilarious .	0
She commented that you are so quiet that your sense of humor always takes people by surprise.Well , actually , she compared you to a silent-but-deadly fart.I 'm totally not making that up.Re : wobble and lick - I 'm sure that the superpower generated would be of the CuteOverload sort .	0
My friend and I were talking about getting flirted with by the non-preferred gender last night .	0
He works at a store on Hawthorne and gets hit on non-stop by both genders .	0
Ben gets hit on ( though he does n't realize it ) by both as well .	0
I do occasionally .	0
But my friend and I agreed that it 's kind of nice either way .	1
As long as it 's not over the top , it 's an ego boost .	0
The world is just trying to remind you that you 're hot .	0
The problem is not the gender , it 's the age .	0
Dude , you are so old , you are like ... ... ... 5 years older than me.D'oh !	0

LOL .	0
Well , I always had a thing for old dudes , so I do n't see the problem .	1
: PHehe .	0
Am I too forward ?	0
Somehow I 've always thought it 's better to be blunt and confrontational , but then again ... bleh.A friend of mine once said `` If being honest means risking a friendship then so be it . ''	0
I do n't think you can have friendship without honesty .	1
Friends have told me nice AND mean things , so it 's hard to tell when I think someone is bullshitting me , so almost by default I have to assume that everyone is full of shit ( unless I 've known them for a while ) .	0
I think when a friendship turns into social politics , you should draw the line .	0
As such , I 'm doing my first lj-cut-a-thon .	0
Do n't worry , though ... I 'm not cutting a lot of people .	0
Inactive journals mostly , but you 'll know when I suddenly seem to quit making entries.Time for some delishus FF3 now : D	0
well being honest with some people is good .	0
However , you ca n't do that with everyone .	0
I know you do n't like the title of best friend , but normally that is the person you can be most honest with.but since you do n't like the `` best friend '' idea .	0
I 'll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with.Ermm ... Ok , that kinda means that being confrontational with everyone is a bad idea .	1
Why ?	0
Well I guess mainly because it 's really hard to get along with other people when there is tension .	0
I guess if you are willing to get along with fewer people , then it 's really no big deal .	0
Hey just wanted to let people know that I coming out from the shallow grave on my LJ as I got access to my LJ password .	0

I have problems being tactful with people , naturally- I just do n't understand the concept .	0
When people ask me `` how is ____ '' , i say `` awesome/it sucks '' , not `` awesomewesome '' delishus gogogo	0
Being forward is great and all , but there are times when you need to approach things a little more carefully to avoid any unnecessary conflict .	0
Too forward , I do n't know , but you 're very forward and it can be annoying ( recent case in point ) .	0
This does n't mean being forward is a bad thing .	0
Blunt is good , but controntational is bad .	1
Confrontational implies attitude and having a bone to pick , when sometimes just saying the truth is effective enough .	0
I 'd figure if a friend can tell you nice AND `` mean '' things , that means they 're not bullshitting you .	1
Its easy to flatter people , but its difficult to tell the truth and say something honest that might sound mean .	0
The truth hurts sometimes , but that does n't make you ( or other people ) full-o-shit jackasses for saying it .	0
Well ... normally I think of confrontational as in ... someone has a problem with me and rather than let it exist , I do something about it ( for better or worse ) .I tend to sway between empathy and lulz , since empathy is obviously better for keeping friends , and lulz is better for stress-prevention .	0
So , yeah ... I try not to be annoying : ( My only excuse for it on the internet , however , is that it 's on the internetAs far as IRL bs goes ... the main example I can suggest is non-concurring opinions .	0
Such as my hand .	0
A lot of people tell me that they never noticed until I bring it up ( bless 'em ) , while others have told me it 's the first thing they notice about me .	0
So , yeah ... that 's what I meant by whether or not someone is BSing .	0
too forward ? do i have to remind you of last night '' you wan na ... hang out sometime and do stuff ?	0

Sigh , no can do - my weekends are all booked up these days .	1
I could probably go for emYojimbo/Sanjuro/em on the Wednesday night .	0
Someday , I hope to say hello ( says the guy who works nights ) .	0
That sounds good too .	0
What time ?	0
Hum .	0
Decisions .	0
The 5:25 Yojimbo might be a bit too tight time-wise , but if I wanted to make a double-bill of it and Sanjuro it 'd probably have to be that way around .	0
On the other hand , if I wanted to see just Yojimbo on its own and make more of an evening of it maybe the later showing would be better ... *puzzles*	0
For what it 's worth ( and I 'm sure someone out there will think this is sacrilege ) , I do n't think it 's emabsolutely/em essential to see them in order .	1
The stories feature the same main character , but do n't depend on each other otherwise .	0
If you do want to try for the 5:25 show , my Wednesday is flexible , so I can get there earlier to get tickets if need be .	1

Tina 's kids have homemade muffins and oatmeal for breakfast ; ) .Also a lot of ( non-organic ) fruit is on the most highly pesticide contaminated list.My kids eat a lot of each.Also , in America Cheerios are breakfast cereal , but in other parts of the world they are sausages , which may contain any number of secret components : -p .	0

Yay , cultural imperialism .	0
They are not the same my friend .	1
American Cheerios are very different in taste and appearance .	0
I was a very disappointed immigrant .	0
It 's weird that you mention that , I was thinking the same thing recently .	1
Other than baby food , it 's the one food that is ubiquitously seen being eaten by babies who are still getting used to using their opposable digits.After pondering this for a while , I eventually concluded that it 's their texture that make them seem the antithesis of evil .	0
1 gram of sugar per serving is a lot less than most breakfast cereals ( e.g .	0
3 grams in Corn Flakes , 4 in Special K ) .But , yeah , the carbs are all refined .	0

According to the Washington Post Web site : President Obama will announce tomorrow that he is extending federal benefits to include unmarried domestic partners of federal workers , including same-sex partners , White House officials said tonight .	0

But now maybe Congress will do the right thing after all.And if not , at least life just got a whole lot better for zillions of civil servants in same-sex relationships .	0
The Advocate is reporting that this will not be an executive order .	0
It will be an executive memo that will expire when he leaves office .	0
Oh and it wo n't cover health benefits or anything else financiala	0
Yup , I saw that this morning ( like the hangover after the night of partying ) .	0
Looks like the Post got it wrong .	0
Sigh .	0
Well I think that was by intent .	0
The whole point was to make it sound like something was happening when nothing was.The DOMA part I can understand , but the temporary memo vs order thing is just pure insult .	0
But something *did* happen .	0
It 's not all that we would have wanted , but it 's more than ever happened under Bush .	0
And it 's not the last word .	0
a to the head of a group advocating for G/L federal employees , Obama *can't* simply unilaterally change pension and healthcare rights without Congressional action.I understand your frustration and disappointment , but do n't treat something valuable as nothing because it 's not everything all at once .	0
Formulation of this may have been started back in January , but somehow it disappeared and the administration has admitted this is only being done because some big money gay donors started to pull out of a big DNC fundraising soiree over the administration 's hate brief on DOMA .	0
In fact , one of the reasons it was not made clear what benefits would be included until today is they announced it before they even figured out what they could put in it .	0
Seems like getting angry and demanding action is exactly what we need to be doing if we want anything to actually happen .	1

I think it must just be the season , everyone I know of is having poor sales !	1
( myself included ) Do you think the name change threw people off ?	0
I remember when I changed my ebay account I lost people .	0
As much as I might consider changing my store name , I wo n't out of fear of fickle buyers !	0
No .	0
This was a slow week right from the start .	0
I began to change stuff ( gallery pic format , layout/background , user ID ) because of the slowness/lower number of hits on my auctions .	0
It might be because I listed sweaters and girdles instead of dresses and coats , it might be because of competition from other sellers ( let 's face it Ebay is so overstocked , it can be hard to get your auctions looked at ) .	1
People also do n't like to look at relisted auctions , and I relsited two .	0
I think things will pick up .	1
I listed stuff last night ( a bunch of short dresses ) and already there is an increase of traffic and watchers on the new stuff listed .	0
I 'm not complaining , really .	0
Things were slow last week as well , and at the last minute things still sold well .	0
You really only need like two bidders .	1
Oh !	0
And you are right about the season .	0
It 's a terrible season .	1
Too late to list coats and too early to list dresses .	0
Whatever you do is risky .	0
I can not keep up with anythiiiing .	0
I have read few fics and replied to few posts and in general been a very fail friend and fan .	0
I hope you are all well , and for those of you who are not , I offer free Jelly-hugs and Jelly-cookies .	0
; _ ; Christmas is hard .	1
D=I am finishing up gift fic tonight and focusing on shopping and wrapping and cooking - oh god why do people let me cook this can not end well - after that .	0
MEN ARE SO HARD TO SHOP FOR OMG CA N'T I JUST BUY YOU SOMETHING PRETTY PLEASE ? ?	0
I need a Bill in my life .	1
I bet he likes pretty things .	0
Or I could just give him a framed picture of these two adorkables~ width= '' 400 '' They 're so cute with their doggie .	0
Honestly , honestly , I love them so much more after seeing them be so loving towards their dog - and I did n't even know I could love them more .	0
They keep doing that , oh .	0
It may make me a bad person , but I 've basically given up buying my dad presents on Christmas entirely and have just been getting him stuff on his birthday and Father 's Day .	0
It 's ridiculous how hard he is to shop for , even my mom is on the verge of giving up .	0
So yeah , good luck with that .	0
There 's just too many holidays , that 's the problem .	0
andgt ; _andlt ; You figure out what to get them for one , and it is wonderful , and then like a week later -- OH OKAY TIME FOR MORE GIFTS .	0
=D And you 've used up any ideas you may have had .	0
D=I still get my dad gifts , but I 'm sort of in the 'lame , non-gifty type gifts ' area for all my family members .	0
I got my mom a dish rack , and I 'm honestly excited over it .	0
andgt ; _andgt ;	0
I too faced the `` what to buy male family member X '' dilemma earlier today and settled on an electric fly swatter shaped like a tennis racket .	0
What man does n't like to electrocute mosquitos ?	0
I think it 's going to be a winner .	0
I think we 're getting my uncle knives , I know how you feel.Oh , I 've had one of those fly swatters !	0
=D They 're really cool .	0
Depending on your family , you may end up having a discussion over who is going to turn the fly swatter on and touch the racket , and what will happen if they do .	0
Just warning you .	0
Oh my brother already assured me that touching it could n't be any worse than sticking your tongue on a 9V battery ( speaking from his personal experience ) .	0
It worries me that he 's an electrician .	0
=D He 's got the know how to stay out of trouble , at least ?	0
Ugh !	0
Shopping for men is horrible .	0
Even the metrosexual guyfriends I have are difficult to shop for .	0
Coffee sounds good .	0
I think most guys would go for food , anything gadget-y and electrical and stuff that makes noise ( and maybe gives off lights , sparks or a laser beam ) .	0
Even video games would go down well if he 's a gamer .	0
Good luck ! And merry christmas , jelly .	0
Your card WILL be LATE , I can guarantee that because I was late mailing it and the post people are all helping out santa at the moment .	0
I just hope it reaches you before the New Year .	0
And your bone structure will be in a different mail .	0
I wo n't forget .	0
I looked at some gadgety things - do you know , in the department store I went to , they had a gadget that was meant to break you out of your car if like , your car trapped you ?	0
It had both the ability to break glass iand/i cut a seat belt .	0
HERE , HAVE SOME FEAR FOR CHRISTMAS .	0
=Dandgt ; _andgt ; Bah .	0
Merry Chritstmasss~ andlt ; 333 You are so sweet to send me a card .	0
And bone structure .	0
*_* andlt ; 33333 So curious !	0
Gosh yes , so cute with their dogs , and I love it that the dogs are so cute with them - they are clearly happy , loved dogs .	0
And twins .	0
Merry Christmas Jelly-O !	0
Happy little fluffy family .	0
=D Merry Christmas to you !	0
andlt ; 333	0
men are impossible to buy for and it 's so frustrating ! !	0
At least with girls , all you have to do is get them something shiny or something that smells good and they will be happy : ) Those pictures of the twins with their dog just made me melt andlt ; 333 Nothing is more attractive than a guy who is not afraid to show his love for his pets : ) Good luck catching up on your Christmas stuff .	0
I 'm going to be shopping on my way to work at 7am tomorrow morning because I fail and forgot my office christmas gifts , and then I have to go out and buy Dirty Santa presents on Christmas Eve - oh joy : /	0
A friend of mine had the same problem now that we made a gift exchange last week , he had to give a gift to one of my male friends and no one could think of something for him !	0
It was so hard I suggested him to give whatever he found at this anime shop , we ended up buying a bag with the Umbrella logo and he seemed to like it XDBtw , it 's early but what the hell , merry xmas darling : )	0
It 's so hard , I swear .	0
andgt ; .andlt ; It 's good he liked it !	0
=D There 's usually lots of cool little things in anime shops.=D Merry Christmas as well !	0
andlt ; 333	0
I totally agree with you with the MEN ARE SO HARD TO SHOP FOR , I always end up with clothes like shirts , strikesometimes underwear /strike o.o , shorts or better yet ... socks ; _ ; omglolThe twins ' doggies are like their kids and they 're couples ; _ ; omg so adorable .	0
Sometimes I wish I was their dog ... XD	0
My mom and I are getting my dad socks .	0
Black socks .	0
Also a belt .	0
Possibly a hat .	0
xD andlt ; 333I knooow .	0
=D It 's so cute .	0
andlt ; 333 Furry little children .	0
ARE N'T THEY ?	0
D= You can get a woman like , anything in any store , but men , I do n't even know .	0
andgt ; _andlt ; I think I 'm getting them coffee.The twins and their doggie , god .	0
They 're so , just , *FLAIL* !	0
I love that they can love their dog that much .	0
There is probably nothing that turns me into a judgmental cynic faster than people who do n't love on their pets .	0
xDGood luck to you too !	0
andlt ; 3 What is Dirty Santa ?	0
That sounds interesting .	0
i ca n't help it - i am extremely judgmental of people who do n't love their pets and take care of them like they should .	0
Animals love you unconditionally .	0
My dog was a rescue and he was extremely abused by his previous owner , yet he is so trusting and loving of everyone .	0
I just do n't get how people can take advantage of that type of trust and devotion : ( Dirty Santa is so much fun !	0
Everyone buys a unisex gift and wraps it with no name tag .	0
Everyone takes turns opening a gift , and if someone gets something you want , you can steal it from them .	0
It 's the most fun if you have at least 10 people because people constantly steal from each other and in my family it can get ruthless XD	0
Oh , me too .	0
My pets are my family , and I can not honestly fathom anyone who does n't treat their animals that way .	0
Your doggie andlt ; 33 !	0
It 's so good he has a loving home now .	0
It 's so unfair the way animals can be treated .	0
If you 're not going to love and adore your pet , do n't get one dammit.Ohhh , we play that game too !	0
=D Though we call it White Elephant - I 'm not sure why .	0
Seeing Bill kiss their doggie while Tom grinned down at them was probably the best part of my day .	0
andhearts ;	0
=DDD That was the cutest !	0
I am so annoyed that was in the middle of the magazine , and hard to see !	0
=O I hope there 's a clear picture of it at some point .	0
Tom is so proud of his bbs .	0
THEY CA N'T POSSIBLY TOP THIS CUTENESS .	0
IAWTCIF WE KEEP SAYING THAT THEY 'LL DO IT AGAIN SOON RIGHT ?	0
I 've finally paid off my credit card debt ! That 's one thing off my list for this year : ) My personal training session on Monday was so very hardcore and stomachbs based that my abs are in sooo much pain , two days later .	1
Everytime I move , even the slightest amount , it hurts.Bending over hurts ALOT .	0
Even putting socks and shoes on hurts .	0
So I 've been sitting in my chair at work , barely moving most of the day.Thankfully.Going to Rock Trivia tonight at the Alibi Room , to raise money for Juvenile Diabetes , and to hang with some friends and maybe make some new friends ! My diet is going pretty well so far .	1
Any time I get a craving for sweets/chocolate I just have some fruit .	0
I 'm really loving Ladyfinger Bananas lately , yum ! My biggest challenge is definitely weekends .	1
Sticking to a diet when you do n't have a regular routine for weekends is tough ! Anyway must flee !	0
grats on CC debt , those things are nasty	0
Yeah I 've been eating a lot of stone fruit myself ; but then I do n't really get chocolate cravings so much .	0
I could murder a carrot cake though .	0
I feel your pain , babe .	1
I 've still got ouchy bits from my Jetski fun .	0

This is weird .	0
When we saw them last weekend they made the announcement that Greg would not be participating right before the show , and made it sound like he woke up sick that morning .	0
I had no idea he has been sick for so long .	1
He looked tired back in July but I 'd never have guessed he was sick ( he had just done two shows in five hours when we met him so 'tired ' was not a surprise ! ) .	0
I 'd also never have guessed he was my age , he looks older .	1
( Which might well be because he was unwell/exhausted , of course . )	0
Wow , he is young !	0
I always keep thinking that if they formed over a decade ago , they should be older .	0

I love the Kate and Eternal Sunshine icons .	0

Dude , Kate Winslet is kind of really awesome .	1
Today as we watched the final act of iHamlet/i , I squeaked giddily to Kyle , `` Kate Winslet is pretty even when she 's playing the corpse of a madwoman ! ''	0
Of course he agreed ; who can argue with the truth ? PS .	0

Do the wheelchair-bound people of america cry every time they park their car/relive the most horrible experience of their life ( assuming they were run down by a car ) ? img id= '' 1 '' > Time for a new logo , guys .	0
You 're breaking hearts .	0
Unless I got it wrong , and by parking your car over a stick-figure-cripple you 're destroying the pain ( ala Upright Citizens Brigade and those Tragedy muffins or whatever ) .	0
heh	0
I was hit by a car and I do n't really care about the handi ... uh ... capable symbol .	0
Of course I 'm not wheelchair-bound so maybe it does n't count .	1
I just get pissed at jaywalkers now .	1
I mean if you 're gon na get hit you should at least do what I did and cross at a crosswalk .	0
Otherwise you do n't get any money .	0
Besides it 's not gon na kill people to walk half a block to the crosswalk .	0
Crossing in the middle of the street might , though .	0
you made my morning , mister !	0
no.i do not drive a car.i drive a wheel chait to and from ny dancing jobs .	0
So the logo can be taken literally ?	0
Like , park your wheelchair here ' !	0

Ive dropped my- myspace- realized i need to be more socially independent .	0
I still havent quite figured out whats going on Next year between the City and Savannah , i have heard ups and downs from both schools which doesnt really help .	0
Ive made atleast twenty pros and cons charts , and they all seem to even out .	0
I am 86 % sure i will end up in New York City .	0
But dont take my word for it , im just a fucked up little girl .	0
I have less then two months left of school , Castleton is slowly descending into a mere memory as opposed to a pathetic present .	0

I bandaged it quickly , but then while applying canvas i stapled that same thumb -- Its now purpley blue for lack of blood -- The funny thing is i didnt realize i stapled it til i noticed the blood dripping onto the canvas -- OooowwWW	0

i recently visited SVA , and even though i 'll be going to Parsons and not SVA , i really , really would recommend you go there .	1

but the advantage SVA has is its ' faculty , internships , etc .	0
the guarantee of a job , as opposed to Savannah .	0

The only good thing about bronchitis.Often , when I have a quiet moment to recline and there are no other sounds ... My wheezing , to my own ears , sounds like the engine of the TARDIS.This is much less cool if one is not a geek .	0

*LOL* I like that sound .	0
Ha ! Kinda like how my old car 's windshield wipers sounded like nazgul .	1
Awful , but still with geek points .	0

from some time ago.Currently living in downtown Vancouver enjoying the bachelor lifestyle.Sunday , after so many years , went back to Sanctuary for the Prom and spent it with the hottest goth girl ( albeit part-time goth ) this side of the continent.Watching Chuck , and still seething from his break-up with Kristen Kreuk last week .	0

i am having another show in april ! !	0

( i will write more about this later probably ) this is exciting and it is good to finally be making a little bit of money doing this too.also , i started doing some through the viewfinder shots ( ttv ) with a kodak duaflex .	0
i really really love them.a title=pink lady by bjorkish , on Flickrimg width=500 height=500 alt=pink lady /i think this is what my april show theme will be .	0

the only tricky thing is matting and framing 12x12 ( or 8x8 ) photos ... . but i have a month to do it , so ... : )	0
True .	0
But square frames are n't so hard to find ... you will just have to do your own matting ... ; - ) Also , Ikea typically has good square frames ( cause square is so mod like that ) a	0
all good news ! !	0
congrats.. and i love how that picture turned out !	0
Awesome news , congratulations ! ! ! !	0
: DI really love the viewfinder theme idea , you have just the eye for snaps that will suit such a theme nicely , too .	0
Yeep sorry , that was me Scarlette .	0
My computer is acting up !	0
the sadness was rising to humiliation , so i ceased this thing .	0
now it only eddies some place dark , infrequently familiar .	0
so im beginning again .	0
i was always terrified of needing someone , it was simpler to feign my strength along with all my other lies but the needing came , irreversible , irrefutable and it swept everything away , the deceptions and my strength .	0
i realise it was a wonderful thing .	0
sometimes im too weak to dress myself .	0
sometimes im too weak to talk .	0
i need .	0
sometimes im too weak to remember .	0
sometimes im too weak to eat .	0
sometimes im too weak to move .	0
i need .	0
sometimes im too weak to love him .	0
sometimes im too weak to stay here .	0
i need .	0
i need and he sees .	0
i need and he 's there .	0
i need and he dresses me .	0
he pushes the food into my mouth , he lifts me from the carpet , he loves me always , he remembers for me , he saves me .	0
and sometimes its never sometimes but every day .	0
You do n't really need someone to save you .	0
Do you really think , if he was n't there to do it , you would n't pick yourself up ? That is what I would say to myself : you think you have fallen to the point where he is essential to push you out of bed , you need somebody to do it and he is the only one that cares enough .	0
But as it turns out you manage faster on your own when there 's no one to crawl into bed with you .	0
Trite ?	0
True .	0
Preachy ?	0
Yep , way way preachy but you do n't need anyone and neither do I. Sticking around for a need is worse than leaving .	0
be warned young Padowanyou are not as dependant as you think you are .	0
remember that .	0
you can be strong , and sometimes you might have to be .	0
just remember , even superman falls .	0
we both know that	0
thank you master kanobi , xxx .	0
although in this case i think needing has been a positive , it 's allowed me to dispell my lies and break down all those walls i had cemented around me	1
Cece and I have been taking voice/singing lessons for a while now : She because she is in a a and me just for fun .	1
Anyway , our a `` voice teacher held a recital the other week where each of his students performed .	0
I sang `` What a Wonderful World '' ( made famous by Louis `` Satchmo '' Armstrong ) and `` Modern Major General '' from Gilbert and Sullivan 's `` The Pirates of Penzance '' .	0
I was a bit stressed out , not only for performing a demanding piece before an audience , but also because it was also the final week of School ( though I think I ended up doing pretty well ) .	1
Speaking about it later , the subject turned to a Lehrer 's parody of the Major General 's Song , `` The Elements '' .	0
We talked about performing emthat/em for the next recital later this year , but I decided not to because it would be too similar .	0
However , I did decide I should sing one of Tom Lehrer 's pieces , I just have to decide which one.What Tom Lehrer song do you think I should sing ?	0
So many good ones to choose from !	0

You have a touching song about humanity and a nice up-beat number .	0
I vote for a touching love song .	0
How about `` I Hold Your Hand In Mine '' ?	0
National Brotherhood Week ?	0
I happen to love Poisoning Pidgeons in the Park , but that 's just me .	0
it 's a toss up between `` masochism tango '' and `` alma '' , both of which are great songs ... .	0
Hmm , How about SMUT !	0
It is a great song .	0
Or his parody of a Chrismas Carol song .	0
Or even The Vatican Rag.My personal vote is for SMUT !	0

off topic , but are you using those the narrow , Atom Omega wheels ?	0
how do you like them ?	0
do you really think the narrower profile give more maneuverability ?	0
Yep , those are the wheels .	0
I like them a lot .	1
I like their grip level for our sportcourt ( which can get pretty slick ) .	0
I do n't do enough quick footwork to really be able to tell a difference in maneuverability , but one thing I appreciate about them is that it cuts down on how much I click or lock wheels with other skaters .	0
I tend to do that far too much .	0
I mean , that 's more a form issue than a wheel issue , but I figure every little bit helps .	0

bNo Dusk nor Dawn/bSomeone lost their mindin the middle of the road.I suspect he knewwhat he was doing whenhe threw it out the window.Nobody has eyes like the moon.Dead , frozen , and dark , hiding the day in shadow.The Winter Night caresfor little but Mayhem.Someone brought about a star.She does things for her own self , and shines in the process.She flares with anger at thehuman sacrifices put down in her namebut does little but watchand grin to herself.Heat in the stomachglares through red , aching eyes.The Summer Sun burnsonly for herself. -- -For Week One over at span class='ljuser ljuser-name_brigits_flame ' lj : user='brigits_flame ' style='white-space : nowrap ; 'a href= ' alt= ' [ info ] ' width='16 ' height='16 ' style='vertical-align : bottom ; border : 0 ; padding-right : 1px ; ' /a href= ' The topic is Luminary and it , along with reflections of my own issues of finding a happy medium , brought about this poem .	0

You wrote this ? I ilove/i this , especially the first five lines .	1
The rest is good too , and very much on par with a lot of contemporary poetry , but especially that part .	0
It breaks the mold of how you usually start the poems you post here , and I love it.I insist you submit it for publication .	0
Gorgeous ! I really like the second verse .	1
Conjures up some beautiful imagery .	0
This is gorgeous !	0
I love the imagery and the use of personification .	1
I especially love the guy throwing his mind out the window ( he lost his mind voluntarily ) .	0
Also , the moon is often connected with insanity ( which you probably knew , based on this poem ) , so it fits together perfectly .	0
I 'm not much of a poetry fan .	0
I find a lot of it to be unwieldy , intentionally throwing off what seems to me to be the natural pace of the words , and focused more on wit and beauty than connection and sense .	0
This has none of those detractions .	1
It is beautiful and it connects , it flows smoothly and draws me in , it 's witty and sensible and it makes me want to pet the words .	0
I love this poem .	0
Thank you for sharing it .	0
I read this once , read the comments below , and then read it again -- this time , slower and out loud.I love the juxtapositions of Moon and Sun/Man and Woman .	0
One mad character , one selfish , both are odd kindreds in some way ... I just ca n't figure out why .	0
It 's been a very long day.This is a play on negatives ; it 's beautifully rendered .	0
My only real criticism comes in the form of the first few lines in each stanza.iSomeone lost their mind / in the middle of the road./iI understand you 're starting out with a general `` someone , '' not revealing the sex or identity until a line or two later .	0
It might ( I say might because this is completely subjective ) be stronger if you stated , `` He lost his mind / in the middle of the road . ''	0
The same goes for `` She brought about a star .	0
`` Just something to think about .	0
= ) Good luck this week !	0
Thank you for sharing .	0
This is a lovely piece of poetry.I agree that the first five lines are wonderfully unique .	0
beautiful ( i love poems about stars ) i love the first lines and how your strong tone builds and builds and the poem progresses .	0
great job !	0

poopie ! i love you !	0
you 're still with andrea but you 're back home again ? i am confused .	0
more information , please .	1
andrea has been out of work for a couple months trying to find a job was a no win situation and then out of the blue her father comes up with i 'm selling the house to buy a motorhome .	0
so we figured it 'd be best just to move down to my moms in san diego and try to get a job .	1
he did n't want me there from the get'go.. but he delt with the fact that his daughter was in love with another woman and he did what he could to bite his tongue.. he let me live there , so i owe the man a lot.. but he 's still a homophobe and is now trying to get andrea back up there with all these job offers AFTER she had already moved down here with me to my moms .	1
get any of that ?	0
that sucks .	0
but at least you 're home with your mom and stuff , right ?	0

Please pass the hot cross buns.I am on a Christian contemporary music site .	0
Each week there are free downloads of new tunes , and also a streaming full length new release album .	0
As a social site , there are also boards , profiles , reviews , and so on .	0
And polls .	0
Here is a poll which could have benefited from some editing : ba you think homosexuals should have rolls in the church ? /bOf course , wear your flame-retardant pure [ unadulterated ] linen ephod if you want to read any of the comments .	0
I hear there are plenty of them under the Table !	0
I 'd be happy to tell any of this sort a certain story about a white pigeon and a cathedral , but it would be , well , like casting pearls .	0
Perhaps with a nice vinaigrette ?	0
On a more serious note I can understand the argument that homosexuals are unrepentant sinners but so are people on their second marriage .	1
Matthew 19:9 Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife , except for immorality , and marries another commits adultery.” Most Protestant churches do let unrepentant adulterers have roles in the church.I mean how can one call oneself a follower of the teachings of Christ and throw out what he was recorded as saying , while applying Old Testament standards intended for priests to the general populace .	0
It 's really a question of Grace is n't it ?	0
I 'm not a Christian so I 'm not sure how Grace figures into this discussion .	0
My understanding is that grace has to do with salvation .	0
This particular argument has more to do with social standards .	0
It is accepted that all people are sinners but Christians are supposed to repent their sins .	0
The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example .	0
Whether unrepentant sinners can achieve salvation is whole different issue .	0
My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook .	0
Christ did n't say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce .	0
Well you can repent of a sin , and then live in grace .	1
If you continue to live in sin though , you have n't repented so you ca n't gain grace .	0
Christ 's admonitions on divorce were really a way to prevent women from being abandoned by their husbands , and leaving families without livelihoods .	0
The different ways Christians handle Grace led to their splitting into hundreds of denominations .	0
If you were Catholic and gay , you could technically cohabitate and be celibate and live in grace , but if you slip up and have sex , you could go to confession and be absolved .	0
Protestants do n't have that option , because they do n't believe their preachers stand in for God , and so they do n't have the power to absolve .	0
And it gets more complicated of course , because some Protestants believe that salvation is through faith alone , some through faith and acts , and some still even believe in Pre-Destination , which means either you 're on the list or your not and nothing you do in this life has a bearing on that .	1
bDo you think homosexuals should have rolls in the church ? /bNo , they should wait to go to the altar and stand before the Priest/Minister before eating any kind of bread *evil grin*	0
I am uncertain if we should have rolls in church , all I have been offered to eat to date is wafers .	0
Mmm , tasty tasty rolls .	0
Hot cross buns , perhaps ?	0
Only if there is hay in said church .	0
Wait ... coffee hour is at 115 ?	0
really ?	0
I 'm overdue for coffee hour then !	0
Well , no , they should n't .	1
They should have rolls in the Parish Hall .	0
No one should have rolls in the church .	0
One is n't supposed to eat in the church .	0
Of course I also sometimes like taking my rolls ( and tea and whatever else looked good at coffee hour ) outside to eat , if there is a place to gather there .	0
Of course , I 'd rather it be a bagel and not a roll , but roll will do .	0
No muffins or donuts or danish , please ! span class='ljedittime'emEdited at 2009-09-09 07:48 pm UTC/em/span	0

That was where I was going.I assume they really meant iroles/i .	0

Maybe it 's more that I just doubt my ability to draw whatever people want me to draw ... be it figures , gangstas , Dali elephants , animals ... but maybe that 's what God made reference material for .	0

Ross has an idea for a tattoo that he wants me to design soon , though , so that might prove inspiring : ) .	0
a it 's not true you have to tat what other people say.some artists can only tat what they can design or draw or what they 're interested in.and if you did boring stuff like fairies and butterflies there 's always templates and that 's just like being paid for tracing !	0

lolhang in there , it 's gon na be ok.love ya !	0
I was extremely upset last night about it ...	0
But your right.. Carder 's plans usually turn out okay.. And he knows what hes doing ...	0
It should be fine .	0
As long as the band does fine , it does n't matter who 's drum major or section leader.I do n't think the band will be good enough though .	0
itll be fine , JC and I will see to that.just wait .	0

Yeah , okay .	0

and well , i may or may not talk to carder tommarow .	0

stacy is going to be an amazing drum major .	1
i have absolute confidence in her .	0
and so does carder , which is why he picked her .	0
if you think your opinion is better than carders , then why dont you go tell him yourself and quit whining about it here .	0
im sure he 'd be FASCINATED to hear about it .	0
just because you didnt get drum major , doesnt mean the band is going to be bad .	0
stacy will be amazing at it , mrs hill , carder , and i have confidence in her .	0
and yes , mrs hill said so , i talked to her .	0
so next time you think youre going to go complain about someone because they got the job you wanted , or for any other dumb reason , maybe you should think that maybe theres a reason they got it .	0
you know , beacuase theyre fit for the job , theyre the best qualified , and everyone knows that they can handle it .	0
dont even start complaining about her anymore .	0
It 's her journal , I 'm pretty sure she can post whatever the fuck she wants on it .	1

I was truly flabbergasted , and a little disgusted with the state of humanity when I saw them .	0
that movie was better than I expected !	0
I super enjoyed it !	0
Ugh I ca n't believe they changed the title to 'Pirate Radio ' ( and took so long to release it in the USA ) .	1
Really ?	0
The Boat That Rocked ( the title it was released with in the UK and NZ ) is so much better .	0
Lol sorry I 'll stop complaining now .	0
That movie is AWESOME.Ew , why would you queue for Twilight ( it 's not like it 's going anywhere ) ?	0
And how do people even have the time ?	0
Oh man !	0
I knew there was something off sounding about the title .	0
I totally never even made the connection that it 'd been changed though .	0
Wow , it 's like a light has just been turned on !	0
lolI really enjoyed it .	0
Got ta grab that one when it comes to dvd .	1
And idek about Twilight .	0
It hurt my soul to see them .	0
Lol .	0
At least the movie is still awesome : D Although I hate it when they change the name of films lol .	0
Heh , the DVD is good too - has fun special features.Lol , they showed some stuff about the New Moon premiere on TV here last night , and some of the girls were saying they 'd been waiting for five days to get a spot on the barrier .	0
FIVE DAYS .	0
Seriously .	0
I was appalled .	1
a `` target= '' _blank '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' Image and video hosting by TinyPic '' name= '' cutid1 '' Did I just spend an hour watching John Simm rub food on his face and maniacally laugh ? Pretty sure all of the Doctor/Master shippers collectively fainted when they got all up in each other 's faces and mind melded or whatever.I hope they go into the development of the cult of Saxon or w/e that was , it was really sudden .	0
Presumably , because at the end of series three they only rewound to right before the arrival of the American convoy , there 'd still be stuff left about Saxon 's existence .	0
Still , how does a former prime minister gather a crazed group of disciples ? The Naismith family also needs some background info , as well as the green people.So are we supposed to assume that the only non-Master people left on the planet are Wilf , the Doctor , Donna , and maybe the green people ?	0
Obviously everyone except for Wilf is protected by not having fully human DNA and thus being immune to the overwrite.WHERE 'S MY GIRL JESSICA ? a name='cutid1-end '	0
Yeah , definitely .	0
Plus , have you seen the list of returning actors ?	0
There are two that are way out of left field , and I ca n't even start to guess how those different episodes are going to be tied together .	0
It also seems like there 's a lot of speculation about Romana coming back ? Maybe at this point , Jack has had enough alien contact to protect him ?	0
Or he could have been off-planet , having left after Children of Earth .	0
idk how he 'd find out about the Master 's takeover , considering that he does n't have the hand anymore .	0
Maybe there 's some way for him to receive a distress signal , or he conveniently wanted to pay a visit to Ianto 's grave or something.Yes !	0
I hope she comes back , that would be brilliant .	0
I also wish that `` Life is short , you are hot '' was actually a reasonably pick-up line .	0
I have n't seen the list no ...	0
Which two are the left field ones ?	0
I dunno , I think that speculation started when River Song appeared .	0
I kind of hope she does n't come back ... She 's my favourite companion and I 'm terrified they 'd ruin her for me.Yeah , must be something like that .	1
The Master 's plan seems to have reached other planets ( Gallifrey for example ) so I guess there 's no reason it could n't reach wherever Jack is .	0
Maybe the Time Lords get hold of him or something.It 's a fabulous pick-up line , is n't it ?	0
Russell Tovey and Jessica Hynes are supposed to be coming back -- apparently there 's something to do with the journal of Time Lord information that Ten had when he was a human .	0
And as far as I can remember , Alonso and Wilf would n't have had any interaction in Voyage Of The Damned .	0
It seems more like there is a Greater Force at stake that 's controlling the Master , and that he 's just being used as part of a larger project .	1
The next episode is going to be some serious business.I still ca n't get over how Simm 's legs look disturbingly good in the Naismith girl 's dress and heels .	0
Oh lord , you 're right when you say you ca n't even begin to string the episodes together .	0
Seriously wtf.It 's possible ...	0
The damn thing with sci-fi is that anything can happen , so it 's difficult to predict .	0
An hour just does n't seem long enough to fit it all in.I know , right ?	0
He was working that dress .	0
Yeah , I love both of them and it 'll be nice to see them , but ... WHAT ?	0
Sure , time is bleeding , but there has to be some significance.I agree , the next episode is going to have to go so fast to cram everything in .	0
I read that it 's supposed to be an hour and fifteen minutes , which helps a little , but there 's still so much to resolve .	0
I 'm still confused by it all although John Simm in a dress made up for some of it.I did think some of it seemed to slip into fanfic territory at times .	0
rofl , he was working the Naismith daughter 's pink dress.Just wait until the green people turn out to be a convenient deus ex machina at the end , haha .	0
That episode was so terrible , my head is still spinning from it 's suck .	1
All the stuff with the Master was absolutely awful , the effects were awful , most of the writing was awful , and even the Doctor was pretty awful most of the episode .	0
It almost made me excited for Matt Smith just so that garbage would end.D :	0
It 's like RTD looked at Last Of The Time Lords and thought , `` How can I be more ridiculous than this ?	0
`` The Doctor and Wilf interaction helped , and it was better than Waters Of Mars , but next week looks like it 'll be a trainwreck .	0
I was so confused by this episode and it actually hurt my head a little bit .	1
The Master reminded me of Gollum from LOTR at timesLOL at the fact that George 's girlfriend , Nina , from Being Human was one of the green peopleNaismith and his daughter had a creepy , borderline incestuous relationshipThe Doctor and Wilf 's interactions made up for some of the confusion , as did seeing the Master in women 's clothing	0
As a Doctor/Master shipper I can confirm that it was pretty exciting and I genuinely thought for a moment Rusty would throw in a kiss , in a flurry of Master-Insanity and Christmas cheer .	0
The Doctor Who Confidential said that the only four left were The Master , The Doctor , Donna and Wilf .	1
Wilf being the only human I guess he 's going to have a huge influence on the saving of the world .	0
Seriously , how did the Master become Voldemort and start jumping over buildings and shooting lightning from his arms ?	0
I totally thought the Naismiths were going to be a couple , too.I agree , the Doctor and Wilf scenes helped a lot .	0
So did the Master in the pink dress.Some of the theories people are coming up with are crazy out there , i.e .	0
Wilf being a fobwatch 'd Time Lord and/or an older version of the Master .	0
I know .	0
I was like , `` Whoa Star Wars force lightening '' .	0
The pink dress was epic.WTF ?	0
RTD has some serious explaining to do because part one was one big clusterfuck of story lines .	0
Yeah , I do n't know .	0
If you look at the comments on the ONTD posts , people are throwing all sorts of stuff out there , like Romana coming back .	0
Though according to Wikipedia , she 's not Romana , she 's the Doctor 's mother ?	0
idk there was also someone who thought that one of the people with their faces covered in the hall of Time Lords was Captain Jack , but the hair does n't look right .	0
The best I can come up with is that the Time Lords are trying to unlock the Time War and are manipulating the Master and the green people to repair Gallifrey .	0
I spent the better part of last night reading some of the theories on EoT but it ended up just irritating me .	0
I 'm feeling sort of ambivalent about part 2 because part of me just wants to figure out what the hell is going on but the other part does n't want the regeneration to happen and knows that I most likely wo n't be satisfied with some of the explanations RTD has to offer .	0
I agree with all of that .	0
Everything points toward Ten having a pretty violent end , and RTD episodes are never as good as you want them to be , with the exception of Midnight .	0
I mean , I know The Master is a Master person , but there were only four people , and both green people would be five , so ...	0
I do n't really know .	0
Seriously , the next episode needs a kiss .	0
Nice way to send Tennant off , haha.If Wilf dies , I will be inconsolable .	0
I do n't think Wilf will die ... There 'd be public outrage .	1
My mother reckons Wilf 's going to have to kill Ten to save Donna or something , 'cause of the whole 'you 've never killed a man ' thing that TV woman said .	0
Hm , that 's interesting .	0
It definitely sounded like he will have a hand in killing someone/thing , at least .	0
Obviously the box thing helped protect Wilf from turning into the Master , but surely there must be something else , considering that the TV was talking to him .	1
Yeah , he 's definitely got a bigger part to play in this .	1
He 'll probably end up saving the world ; it seems to run in their family .	0
Even though the next episode promises to be even more ridiculous , I 'm still excited .	0
It 'll be interesting to see how Donna 's memories are preserved.Also , Jack is going to be messed up after Children Of Earth .	0
Yeah , despite the fact The Sound of Drums/Last of the Time Lords was an all-round good two-parter , I do n't think Rusty can pull that off again .	0
Next week 's is probably going to be a disaster .	1
Oh yeah ... Wonder what they 're going to do with Jack .	0
Wonder if he 's turned into a Master clone too.Did you notice btw that Wilf 's bus was called Sparrow Lane and he mentioned the name Sally on the bus ?	0
Thought that was too big a coincidence .	0
Yay !	0
We brought some things back from Maia 's house.Namely , the GameCube and her stereo ... Now we have a 'lil bitty TV atop a television stand , speakers on either side of the TV , a Sega Genesis , a PS One , a GameCube , corresponding games and controllers , CD 's and DVD 's , and the receiver .	0
It 's full ! Next , I steal the N64 back from Lin ( and find a way to fit it in with the other systems ) .	0
I 'm sure she wo n't mind , now that she has a PS3 ... . oh , and maybe a larger TV ... with more inputs ... and a DVD player ?	0
audio input is hooked up for the sound system ( meaning anything can connect to projector now ) if you ever drop by sometime	0
How much longer do you have until they kick you out of Nike ?	0

Awesome !	0
If you 're looking for a cheap bigger t.v. , there is the pawn shop right next to Big Lots on Colonial ( sorta near the corner of Alafaya and Colonial heading towards Wal*Mart Super ) that sells t.v . 's .	0
I got my 19/20 inch for $ 40 , the guy said he 'd add a universal remote for $ 5 ( mind you this was freshman year ... but I doubt things have changed that much , you can pick up a universal remote for the same price at Wal*Mart or Target ) .	0
So it 's not bad at all .	1
Just in case money is an issue and all .	0
Thanks for the tip !	0
So I guess I did n't stretch enough or probably moved wrong at the gym ... I hurt my lower back .	1
I 'm still mobile but now when I try to get up after sitting to long or try to bend over I look like I 'm 90 ... .. hey sunny can ya pass me my cain ? ouch** and yes I 'm at work too.ME+ pain = img	0
auuuuu ... .sorry to hear that : /// hope you fell better soon dear !	0
! and that animation is just so funny ; ) )	0
hehe yeah I 'll be ok just need to stretch it out.hehe thought you 'd like that .	0
sounds like a pinched nerve .	0
sit on the floor and pull your knees to your chest .	0
then kneel down and repeat pulling.. i guess chest to knees .	0
then have someone rub your back .	0
should release it .	0
Yeha could be .	0
I 've been doing then stand up and bend over thing and helps but if I sit to long and try to get up I 'm all bent over.I can still walk and go up flights of stairs but the bending over..oouh	0
Owie !	0
I hope you feel better soon !	0
yeah just a little stiff ... .	0
Make the husband give you a massage when you get home !	0
I 've been like that since before Christmas and all I did was coughed .	0
I was off work for 2 weeks after a hernia op then a few days after going back I was like an old man .	0
they were really worried thinking I 'd done something to the hernia , now they 've got used to it and do n't notice me hobbling around .	0
Your still walking like that ? by the way that pigeon is disturbing ... . : -O	0
I 'm not as bad as I was when I first did it but just when I think its getting better it gets worse again .	0
If you think the pigeon is disturbing I wo n't show you duck dastardly ; )	0
There is so much housework to do I just want to cry .	1
Good thing there 's a computer to procrastinate with .	0
I would n't let *you* see my bathroom right now , let alone Mom , God forbid , lol !	1
OMG it 's SO BAD .	0
We *did* win a free carpet cleaning for halloween from the apartment complex , so that was VERY handy , what with the technicolour dog vomit stains all over , lol .	0
And the kitchen really is n't bad right now .	0
The closet is a disaster , and all of our clean clothes are piled up in the garage on top of Alaric 's project car , while the closet is full of empty doll and action figure boxes .	0
Sigh.Anyway , how 's you ? ? ?	0
Miss you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	0
How 's mum ?	0
How 's the kids ?	0

I had to put Sadie down this morning .	1
She had pancreatic cancer , and she was wasting away .	0
I 'll go into the full story later , but I just wanted to let all of you know.She came into my life exactly when I needed her , and she needed me .	0
I rescued her , but she saved me .	0
This was my last gift to her , and I miss her already .	0
The last couple years were a good time for her , and for you .	0
I 'll see you soon , and there will be hugs .	0
I am so , so , sorry , my dear .	0
Believe me , I know all too well what you 're going through.Be well .	0
Take your time grieving .	0
It took me a year and a half after Cassia passed away before I could assist in a euthanasia without totally losing it , so believe me when I say : take your time grieving .	0
Oh Liz , that 's terrible .	0
I 'm so , so sorry to hear that .	0
I 'm sending love and hugs .	0
She knows you did it because you care .	0
Be safe in that knowledge .	0
( Hugs and Kisses from Afar ) You and Sadie were lucky to have each other .	0
You 'll always share those memories .	0
My condolences on your loss .	0
Take good care of yourself .	0

Yes , it does totally sound exactly like a sequel to a book called iAmong Others/i .	0
Good choice .	0
That 's a great title on its own , and it does pair perfectly with iAmong Others/i , too.P .	0

Nothing new here -- it 's great !	0
Yes , it totally sounds like a good sequel title .	0
I like it !	0
The Library of Congress catalog shows only two other books of that title , one nonfiction , one poetry , neither famous as far as I know .	0
Does n't seem likely that there would be any confusion .	1

I like this one too .	0
I like this one better .	0

That sounds like a good title idea .	1
It 's good on its own , and it definitely pairs strongly with citeAmong Others/cite .	0
I like it too.Only ion is that the pair of them sound like early-70s SF .	0
Maybe Simak or Laumer .	0

Why is it that nobody is ever interested in you when you 're single ... then once you start dating someone , everyone wants to fuck you ?	0
I really do n't get it .	0
If you 're looking for an honest answer , then I think it has to do with the confidence that being in a relationship brings .	1
That confidence is attractive to other people .	0

I thoroughly enjoyed it , less for the whinging and more for the astute observations of Hollywood culture .	0
I do n't know ... I do n't feel like it 's so astute to point out that the Oscars are kind of pompous and out of touch .	1
Plus criticisms like that , coming from someone who lost , just come off as petty .	0

In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is `` the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government 's aggressive foreign policy , etc . ''	0
She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others .	0
`` They must start to look at their own behaviour , the permanent heightening of the planet 's insecurity since the election of Bush , '' she told La Presse .	0
`` All senators received the letter from the McLellans and I was the only one to respond , '' she said./blockquotea article .	0
That is so awesome .	0
I hope it was CC 'd to Paul and Linda .	0
You can count on it .	0
I do n't want to get argumentative on LJ , but why do n't you agree with the seal hunt ?	0
Do you agree with hunting deer ?	0
Culling cat and dog populations by neutering ?	0
The unfortunate truth is that we 've killed off many of the predators that kept seal populations in check ( like we did with deer and moose , etc ) .	0
In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they 're on the extinction list ... they have n't been doing alot lately .	0
The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s ... and do you know how much they eat ?	0
They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked .	0
I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I do n't like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary .	1
I also do n't have any jobs to give to those 15000 Inuit , native , and traditional hunters who earn a living from this enterprise ... I 'm sorry to go off on you - I 'm just so angry at Americans for writing , and for Paul McCartney 's photo op in PEI .	0
I 'm off the soap box , unless there 's a rebuttal ?	0
No , no rebuttal here .	0
The truth is that I disagree with the seal hunt in principle , in the same way that I disagree with game hunting .	1
But I can also see that this is a situation that us humans have created with overfishing and the like .	0
So really , there is no right answer .	0
Also , I 've heard arguments on both sides of the seal hunt , without really having any hard data that 's impartial.It just really yanks my chain that some stupid americans would be so self-righteous to think that we would give a shit about their petty protest , even though they have contributed more to destabilize the planet than any other human act .	0
Do n't get me wrong Chris , I could n't kill anything - I think .	0
But I still enjoy a Big Mac ... as for the Americans , I 'm getting pretty ticked off with them lately.They 've got pictures circulating of people from Abu Ghraib , covered in what appears to be shit and blood , being beat , hung upside down , raped and worse - though I shudder to think of what could be worse than what I 've seen so far .	1
AND THEY dare to say they are n't going to holiday here because seals are being killed ! !	0
There is also a group rallying against our practices with sheep ! ! !	0
( Sheep have a flap of 'foreskin ' type thing that hangs off their butts and gets painfully infected by parasites and leads to their death - so sheep herders in the maritimes have been and other peoples have been cutting that skin off for THOUSANDS OF YEARS - but now they 're writting letters to us demanding we ban it.FUCK OFF - you know ?	1
Why do n't you stop torturing people ?	0
Dropping more bombs in Iraq this week than any other time since 2003 ?	0
I am so mad about Americans this week , I could vomit with it .	0
Poem `` Eleison '' will appear in the January ( or possibly February ) issue of a is especially gratifying because while I 've always liked the piece , it 's weird and inaccessible , and I figured I 'd probably never find a home for it -- goes to show that if someone 's willing to publish something like that , there 's hope still for all my esoterica .	1
And see -- that 's one of the joys of submitting !	0

I knew decomP would love you too !	0

Yes , exactly -- as soon as I saw that was the one they 'd accepted , I immediately thought about your lj entry about the giraffe rape poems .	0

I need to sell some of my managa as I have moved in with my boyfriend and we own some of the same stuff .	0
I 'll ship anywhere in the world.Naruto 1-11 : £2 each OR all for £18Black Cat 1-2 : £3 each OR both for £5Bleach 1-4 : £3 each OR all for £10Battle Vixens 1-10 : £3 each OR £27Excel Saga 1 : £3Dragonball Z 1 : £2PandP prices depend on how many manga you buy from me due to the weight.My email is mewski @ gmail.com or comment here if interested.UK payment : accept cheque or paypal ( preferred ) .Other countries : Paypal only .	0
The whole lot of Naruto and Battle Vixens tempts me so ... ... , or given my needing to not overspend , perhaps just the Naruto manga .	0
Can you give me a quote on the postage for all eleven Naruto manga you are selling ? Thanks muchly .	0
I 'll give them a weigh and see what Royal Mail says .	0
Will reply when I can find something to weigh them with ^^ ; Kinda got a party on tonight .	0
Okies thanks .	0
£4 .	0
There 's a bit more space in the box actually but if you are certain you just want Naruto then I 'll just put more bubblewrap in there to keep them all safe : ) My Paypal is mewski @ gmail.com or you can send a cheque .	0
Considering recent events in my life , I think I 'll buy Battle Vixens and DBZ as well .	1
^_^ Will it all fit in one box , and is there any discount for buying bulk ? ... ... ... .Actually , would you sell the whole lot of them of them , PandP included , for £65 , grand total ?	0
All the manga you are selling plus PandP ... ..£65 ... . ? If that sounds agreable to you , I 'll buy the lot of it .	0
Sounds totally fair : ) Paypal mewski @ gmail.com or if you rather pay by cheque tell me your email and I 'll send you my address .	0
Excellent .	0
: D I 'm in no hurry for them , so if I paid you by cheque you 'd get more money since paypal take a cut of each transaction , right ?	0
By cheque you 'd get 100 % of the money , so better that way for you really.My email is mutsumi @ hotmail.co.uk You had this addy on your hotmail a year ago , but I 've not seen you online since that time we fell out of good terms over ALcon .	0
Since neither of us go on AL anymore , would you be interested in talking again ?	0
I prefered it when we were good friends .	0

Just a lil ' reminder that I have moved 90 % of my used-to-be-journal activities to Facebook !	0
Find me as Red Tango and add me as a friend .	0
I will be relegating this journal strictly to RedTango oriented promotional announcements and maybe some artwork for the foreseeable future .	1
I just ca n't keep up with updating in more than one place , and at the moment I 've found Facebook to be a better format for my personal ramblings/mocking of various things and interactivity with readers .	0
Hey , these things happen !	0
Hey there how about adding a link to your Facebook page for all of us .	0
Any Facebook page can be accessed by typing in the person 's name after facebook such as : facebook.com/redtangoor just go to facebook.com and add me as a friend .	0
The name is Red Tango.You will have to sign up to join Facebook yourself , it 's not public like this journal is .	0
Hope that helps !	0
i cant seem to find you on face book ? ?	0
I 'm there , under Red Tango .	0
Two words .	0
I like to think of myself as a very open minded person .	0
I have a lot of friends who have all sorts of political and sociological beliefs .	0
I was semi appalled at some of the whole 'buy into my philosophy or get out of my life ' crap that was going on during the election cycle.But if you think Leno is funnier then Conan , Letterman , Ferguson , or even Kimmel you can just get the fuck off my friends list right now .	1
Sorry , some lines have to be drawn in the sand.Also feel free to tell future generations that network television started to die the day they gave Leno a prime time talk show .	0
I know none of these people - I 'll stick with Eddie Izzard , Stephen Fry and Billy Connelly thanks : )	0
Yeah ...	0
I 'm going to have to back Doris up on Stephen Fry .	0
He knows all !	0
andgt ; __andgt ;	0
Nice Eva icon .	0
Why , thank you !	0
I have a couple ... . : )	0
I dislike Conan and Leno , and I maintain Kimmel is nothing without Corrola .	0
Ferguson has the potential to be funny ( ala his appearance on Real Time ) , but I have n't watched his show yet .	1
Ah , opinion .	0
I still think Stern is funnier than them all .	1
They all steal some of his bits sooner or later anyway .	0
ferguson rocks.kimmel gives the best interview.conan is hit or miss but damn funny when he hits.dave is just weird and lecherous and unpleasant .	0
was n't always .	0
is currently .	0
I LOVE CONAN THE MOST .	0
NBC suicided when they canceled Friends and Will and Grace in the same year .	0
Agreed one thousand percent .	0
Bill Hicks was right about Leno then , and he 's right now .	0
He does n't so much make jokes as he indicates the spot where a joke should go .	0
I 'll take Conan , you can keep the rest.Especially Kimmel .	0
the only thing funny about leno is his face .	0
I was going to say his hair ...	0
the two combined are lethal .	0

Some dude created what is likely the most difficult custom levels for the original Super Mario Bros .	0
Some other dude has made a video of his attempt at playing through them , complete with a running commentary .	0
Everyone needs to see this .	1
It 's 25 min long , but you should watch it to the end .	0
It is one of the most magical videos ever created : at once inspiring , frustrating and demented .	0
The slow spiral of this man 's sanity down into a mental abyss of his own perpetuation eventually turns the experience simultaneously existential and Zen , heroic and tragic -- nihilistic , yet delightful .	0
The collective need to anthropomorphize entities and events that evoke emotion is explored and , in turn , a step in understanding our consciousness is taken .	0
I could probably write a ten-page paper on why this video encapsulates what it means to be a human being .	0

my lord .	0
burst my guts out laughing .	0
but ooh .	0
what torture .	0
TORRRTURE ! so .	0
see you soon , paul , i hope .	0
I like the way this guy says cock .	0
Wow , this is so much better with the commentary .	0
I first watched it in the original form ( I left it open playng in the background for a while because it was just too frusterating/sad to watch the repetitions ) .	0
my live journal name sucks ballsand it really should n't matterexcept that if i was someone else and i saw me online i would n't talk to mebecause i sound all angst-ridden and tragic .	1
its too bad i started my account when i was all twelve years old and dangerous .	0

You can always change it to something that suits you better now ; you do n't have to get a new account or anything.But I do n't think your current one sounds tragic , just a bit cute .	0

ha i hate to admit it but i think i like paris hilton 's song `` stars are blind ''	0
Me too !	0
Her voice reminds me of Gwen Stefani 's .	0
I think that 's why .	0
Because when I first heard it I was like `` WTF ?	0
Gwen made a new song already ? ? ? ''	0
its a low rate gwen stefani song .	0

Also , if you 're getting into town on Sunday , you 're more than welcome to hang out with us that afternoon/evening , too .	0
I 'm supposed to get into town around 4:30 or so Sunday afternoon , and another one of us is supposed to be meeting me at the hotel that evening .	0
I thought maybe we 'd grab dinner and try to find something fun to do ( which may be hard in Cleveland on a Sunday night , but ... we can try ! ) .	0
If you decide you want to hang out with us , just give me a call !	0
that 'd be awesome !	0
im getting there sunday at 11:30am prolly gon na grab something quick to eat and check out the rock n roll hall of fame , thats all i really have planned so far .	0
call me when you get into town !	0
or ill call you around that time if i dont hear from you : )	0
Sounds like a plan !	0
I 'm not sure when my friend is getting into town , but I 'll give you a call once I check in and get all settled .	0
I 'll probably want to take a quick shower , but that should n't take too long.I 'm glad you 'll have time to check out the HOF while you 're in town !	0
I 've been there probably 4 or 5 times , and every time I see new stuff I 've never seen and it 's always fun .	0

It veered dangerously close to being a protest !	0
You could have been mistaken as an opponent of capitalism !	0
Opponent of wasteful bailouts using taxpayer money to socialize losses [ not equal ] opponent of capitalism !	0
It is actually existing capitalism.Just as actually existing capitalism socializes ecological problems .	0
Actually existing capitalists know that their over all economic interests are served by state intervention and investment .	0
Socialists are those wacky people who think that if you are going to socialize losses , you should also socialize gains .	0
( If you are also going to prime the economy with Keynesian , then you should invest in infrastructure that is more practical than military ) .	0
One does not protest True Free Market Capitalism , because like fairies , it does n't exist .	1
Telling fairies that they do n't exist is largely regarded as rude .	0
Oh yeah ... and BRAAAAIIIINNNSSS !	0
Oh god , not this again .	0
YAWN.I thinbk it 's amusing that we can disagree yet the outcome - the protest - is the same .	0
It does n't matter to me why this is , people can protest for their own reasons yet still be protesting the same thing .	0
In this case , the libertarians and the socialists can ride the blood-covered bull in peace ; )	0

I first must start blowing the dust off this sucker and gather my thoughts into some sort of coherent order .	0
You shall then have an entry that will rival the works of Dickens or Dostoevsky !	0
Huzzah !	0
i added you.i think because of the `` Huzzah '' s ... .or maybe because of the NC-17 rating ... it could have been the uber-entertaining writing too ... most likely tho , it 's just plain old jellousy .	0
some of us are just that simple	0
It 's great to see you back .	1
I for one have missed you much , though I 'm sure there are plenty more who have as well .	0
You have a knack for making friends heh .	0

Herobear and the Kid !	0
strongCartoonist Mike Kunkel is brilliant/strong in every sense of the word -- and much like Little Nemo in Slumberland , this book captures the heart and imagination , bringing out the wide-eyed child in even the most jaded person./font/font/font/font/font/font/font/font/fontpfont size=1font color= # 800000font size=5font size=1font color= # 800000font color= # 800000 size=3font size=2font color= # 800000font color= # 800000The book revolves around young Tyler , who receives an old broken locket and a stuffed bear as an inheritance when his grandfather passes away .	0
Not exactly the sort of thing a ten-year-old would want to play with , but he soon learns not to judge a bear by its cover ( oh , the bad pun .	0
it hurts ) .	0
For the little toy bear can strongmagically transform into the 10 foot tall super hero polar bear/strong named HEROBEAR ... and the rest is history .	0
What first looks like just a light , enjoyable read becomes captivating and a real page-turner as Herobear and Tyler try to strongdecipher the note his grandfather left him/strong , leading him to the revelation that his grandfather was MUCH more than he seemed !	1
Before long , Tyler realizes his grandpa was none other than Santa Claus himself , and that Tyler is supposed to replace him , as has every grandson in the history of his family .	0
truly brilliant book -- check out the comic and graphic novel ( which I picked up for a measly 5 bucks at a con , lucky me ) from Astonish Comics.strong I ca n't recommend anything higher .	1
So there ya go !	0

Awesome .	0
that 's the coolest freakin thing i 've heard all morning .	0
when did this happen ?	0
I 'm not even sure it 's not completely apocryphal , although I do n't believe it 's an outright lie .	1
From my research they both played a festival in SF in 1990 , so the story is at least possible .	0
a	0
definitely possible .	1
that was right around the timeice t started touring with bodycount , was n't it ? ... so he made friends with numerous rock bands .	0
plastic legend or not , it at least sounds cool .	0
p class=MsoNormalCakes , why do they all look like cakes ?	0
This year’s prom dress assortment is a fabric realization of what can only be described as Betty Crocker’s nightmare .	1
True to the gluttonous American , these crude confections have enough tulle to feed a third world fishing village , enough sequins to outfit an entire army of transvestites , and enough fabric to clothe all seven the Von Trap children with still a generous portion left over for their fat great aunt .	0
It’s a wonder these posh teens can even fit through door frames with such voluminous skirts .	0
It seems to me that the overwhelming mass of their garments is only accentuated with the ridiculous level of adornment ; it’s as if someone reached back into the early 90’s , got their hands on a Bedazzler and went plastic rhinestone crazy .	0
p class=MsoNormalspan style=/spanI can’t help but be suspicious that these garments are some sick practical joke devised in a full blown fashion conspiracy…p class=MsoNormal	1
There has to be some relatively drug free party somewhere , I just assumed Paxon kids would be more likely to throw one than Stanton kids.The only reason I 'm going is because it 's free .	0
THEREFORE , you should n't go at all .	0
Go on a road trip with me instead .	0
Where are you going ?	0
O.o I think you 're just a quitter !	0
Cakes !	0
Completely understood .	0
And Tess you 're going to prom too on the same day as us as well .	0
Danielle I believe prom dresses are made in order to advertise cake , yes cake .	0
Hey you look like a cake , now go eat one.The end .	0
How subliminal , and ineffective .	0
I ate sushi .	0
I can hope I do n't look like a cake in my dress , but I would still much rather go on a roadtrip than attend my senior prom .	0
Which may be slightly sad.Also , whoever is responsible for scheduling all Paxon and Stanton events on the same days needs to be shot.andhearts ; Lauren .	0
Agreed , it 's as if they plan these things to cut down the non-competitive atmosphere between our school .	0
Bastards .	1
The only reason our schools are competitive is because the administration choose to do things like this : force us to choose between our own school and everyone else .	0
and , of course , we are obligated to choose our own school.I may crash some Paxon after party , because I miss you guys , but Stanton prom is free , and your prom is expensive .	1
Woah seriously ?	0
How unfair , Paxon kids really get screwed in that respect ... andgt ; .andgt ; I did n't even know there was an after party !	0
gacked from maya cus i am bored tooScan my interest list and pick out the one that seems the most odd to you.I 'll explain it.Then you post this in your journal so other people can ask you about your interests .	0
grotesquebeauties.i am intrigued .	0
: ) ) I guess that goes back to some drawings I saw by DaVinci , of grotesque faces that caught his attention while walking down streets .	0
he would remember them and sketch portraits later .	0
the drawings are obviously breathtaking .	0
a super-vain and all I think that 's cool ... it 's like love where you find someone conventionally unattractive , to be quite beautiful ... cliche..yes yes..but so true	1

your interests nail it to the basics ... that 's good .	0
I was a little indulgent.The boy was someone from school and I googled the hell out of him .	0
a professional sort of infatuation I guess .	1
I liked his passion and his blatant attempts at challenging the ( design ) authority at school and outside ... it 's over now that my interests lay elsewhere ... winkwink	0

Finding good contractors can be hard , and there are sooo many horror stories.Also , does anyone have a table saw that I could use for a few cuts ?	0
I 'm not sure yet if I 'll actually need it , though .	0
you know about elbow-joints , right ?	0
I can loan you a circ saw if you do n't find a table saw .	0
I have a table saw !	0
You 're welcome to come use it .	0
( I 'll email you my summary of references from elbow-joints )	0
I 'm good at finishing hardwood floors !	1
Steve and I did that in our last apartment , to get rid of the disgustingly pet-soaked carpeting .	0
I know where to rent the sanders , and how to finish the corners , and how to apply the polyurethane .	0
I think , if I had it to do over again , I would concentrate more on the edges and use non-water-soluble poly.I 'm not an expert , but I 'm also going to be doing this on our floors in a couple of months .	0
: ) If you want an expert , though , we have a pair of carpenters that did a floor in my old landlord 's apartment , and it looked beautiful .	0
They 're currently working on our house , but should be done and looking for a new project in February or March ...	0

I meant to comment on this earlier -- wow !	0
Love the sense of movement and the skintones on the prone woman .	1
They really pop against those nice purples .	0
Awesome- but a quick thing I noticed- it looks like the thumb on the witch-lady 's hand is coming out of her ring finger .	0
At least , I think it 's a thumb .	0
I could be wrong .	0
Heh , this is what happens when I model for stuff - apparently my hands ( esp .	0
thumb ) do not behave like normal people 's .	0
Will go fix , thanks !	0
Quick fix all in all ; ) I love it .	0
You really ought to do a few detail shots so we could see up close !	0
Fab !	0
I think it 's my favorite of your pieces .	0
You did indeed fix the bits I mentioned , and I think the piece is the better for those changes .	0
But now the prone woman 's hair needs to fall ( at least most of it ) .	1
I think that by bringing the hair down a bit diagonally and having it blow around you 'll make her more feminine into the bargain ...	0
I concur about the thumb ( just fade it back a little into the magical mist and you should be golden .	0
The aspect ration seems a bit wide/short to me .	0
I 'd shave some of the right side off ( about 1/2 inch or 1/2 of a spine width if this was a paperback cover ) and add a bit to the top.I love the blowing leaves and I 'd include some more of those lower right as well .	0
All my picayune detail-orientness is really just my saying BRAVO !	0
This is already a champ , and should become an even mightier one .	0

I wish I could paint like him.And I suppose it is good to be back ... but I got used to being nonsocial and it gets hard to talk to people after not interacting for a while .	0
those are paintings ? ! yes .	0
I know how that is ...	0
YES !	0
They are oil on linen ... he is an artist genius .	0
this is just ... beyond comprehension .	0
kind of like Gottfreid Helnwein .	0

I personally use Imageshack , but they 're not quite as awesome as they used to be since they 've gotten sneakier and wo n't give you the direct link to your photos right away .	1
But are you coming to the FARM PARTY	0
I use photobucket .	1
The end .	0
HOW COME ?	0
It 's reliable , pretty easy , and as long as the image does n't get whored out too much , your image is there FOREVAR .	0
Also , it has a sense of humour ( search for 'porn ' and it tells you 'officially we dont allow this stuff but umm ... if youre sure , we can show you what comes up ! ' ) ...	0
I find it humourfull.ALSO .	0
I like the yellow guy .	0
He reminds me of Sin City .	0
I use Photobucket because it 's easy and the service it provides is enough for what I do ( read : not a lot ) .	0
But I would n't recommend it if you intend on linking a lot of people to it because it has a tendency to go `` OMG TOO MANY PAGE VIEWS EXCEEDED BANDWIDTH WE ARE GON NA MAKE DIS IMAGE UNAVAILABABLE UNTIL NEXT MONTH ! ''	0
I -could- be wrong about it , but I 'm pretty sure I 'm not.I was going to suggest Facebook , but FB has a 60 image limit per album and uploads can be a bit of a bitch .	1
It crashes a lot in the middle of big uploads , which is very frustrating .	0
Hello dear .	0
Met you at the farm party .	0
Hope you pop over to G Town at some point .	0
flickr is easy and reliable and made for hosting stuff for blogs etc .	0
, its also freewell free accounts means you get 200 images , then they start being hidden , but they are still there , if you got past that amount , but then get an paid account they all appear again , whee .	0
Only 200 images ?	0
? Well anyway , I 'll see if I can find some detailed information about Flickr somewhere ...	0
it 's so you pay up to be able to show more than the last 200 uploaded .	0
and also once paid you can have lots of sections and stuff to organise everything , if you have a paid LJ account the hosting here in the scrap book is really good as well .	0
i have hundred of images up as for really free ones , maybe deviant art , they allow out side linking in blogs these days and theres no limits .	0
slightly annoying up load procedure , one file at a time upload etc .. photobuckets seems to suck big time , never used it personally , just judging but the amount of times i see 'this image unavailable hosted by photobucket ' stuff around	1
That may be ( about Photobucket ) but they do n't make your pictures as ridiculously small as flickr does , which sucks a lot for drawings .	0
but you just need to click on the view all sizes to see it bigger , easy peasy : P	0
NO WAY !	0
WAY !	0

You had an entry before , it was a long comic with puzzle holes in the faces ... do you have alink ?	0
ive been looking through your threadless ... i hate comments .	1

i dont understand the site .	0
hey dude , I found this old construction paper while I was thrifting today and it 's really neat , something happened to it and made this weird sort of tie-dye effect ... do you want it ?	0
When I saw the paper it reminded me of your stuff .	0
It 's like this , only brighter bit more neon and there are quite a few more colors : have a whole booklet of it , and if you want it I 'll send it to you .	0
oh man that looks awesome !	0
i will send you something back in return if you do .	0

: ) It was the Passing of the Colors aujourd'hui and now I am ( I think ) officially a Panther .	0
*runs around with pink ears clipped to hair* Pink Panthers , rarrrr .	0
I 'm excited .	0
*bounces* At first I was like , blah , okay , yay , mascots , and then when the seniors handed over the `` Large and sometimes scary '' Pink Panther sequined head , I was like , `` Oh , my God , we 're PANTHERS NOW .	0
SQUEE .	0
`` O THE RESPONSIBILITY . What was really freaky was when the sophomore fainted in the bleachers .	0
I looked up just in time to see her faint and I kinda freaked out .	0
The only time I 've seen something like that was when my mom had a panic attack and completely froze up- she could n't move .	0
Scare-reeeee.And now I would like to direct your attention to our Neville/Luna community , span class='ljuser ljuser-name_copper_pennies ' lj : user='copper_pennies ' style='white-space : nowrap ; 'a href= ' alt= ' [ info ] ' width='16 ' height='16 ' style='vertical-align : bottom ; border : 0 ; padding-right : 1px ; ' /a href= ' which now has it 's May challenge .

WHY could n't they have simply made it PM assembly ?	0
stupid AP English exam ... Yeah , it 's the monstrous panther head that does it .	0

Panthers are the best mascot , for seriously !	0
Oh and you get the Pink Panther curse too , unfortunately .	0
Apparantly it 's legend : every year the Pink Panthers are in their Senior year , something goes wrong .	0

*tries to cling to dancing bears outfit* Ack .	0
*sighs and accepts it*Our cheer sheet says that it 's `` We are the Pink , we are the big number one '' but I 've always thought it was `` We are the Pink , we are the pink number one . ''	0
I 'm so confused !	0
Half our class lost their minds in the `` na na na na nanananandodgbananalldlfnana '' part .	0

It 's a deal !	0

It IS `` We are the Pink , we are the PINK number one ! ''	0

I am quitting smoking .	0
Again .	0
Except this time I 'm not pregnant or nursing and do not have that motivation .	0
Have to do it for my health , and the fact that I seem to be a bitch when I do n't have a cigarette during the weekend because I was itrying/i to hide the fact that I have been smoking again from my husband .	0
Obviously , that did n't work.And so here my addictive personality sets in .	0
I feel the need , the craving , the burning desire to rush out to a store and purchase a pack of cancer ( seeing as my significant other has destroyed the pack that he came across hidden not-so-well in my car ) already .	0
The agony , the defeat , the ineed/i ... This sucks ass .	0
I hate you all.But .	0
There is always a but , or butt .	0
Mmmm , cigarette butt.For all my pain and suffering and once I can prove I can quit , again : I AM GETTING MY TATTOOOOOOOO IN TWO WEEEKS ! ! !	0
( No , I refuse to wait longer than that , Richard , if I am meant to suffer ! ) WOOOHOOOO !	0
I ca n't wait .	0
It almost makes the suckage of it all bearable .	0
Almost .	0
i 'm going to get my tattoo in two weeks as well for my birthday .	0
you should join Seth and I in tattoo getting .	0
As for the cigarette thing .	0
I went through that back in Janruary .	0
It sucks ass .	1
I think that the group tatting sounds awesome .	0
I need to try to find a pic of what I want .	0
I am in dire need of a new artist.Yay !	0
well if you like my fish tattoo , then this lady is good for you .	0
Who do you go to ?	0
I guess I 'm going to have to have someone do a sketch because I ca n't find a print of what I want .	0
She 's this hippy lady named Crystal .	0
She 's owns her own shop in Sarasota .	0
so I am feeling that I should put something motivating and encouraging here but that REALLY isnt my style but I dont want to be a jerk either which is my style ... ... ... .so I am for the most part stuck ... ... so I guess goodluck and yay tattoo	0
Thanks sweetie .	0
I wish I could say I am doing this for the good of my health .	0
But fuck my health .	0

If you want to age something so it tastes like oak , go get some good scotch or whisky .	0
Rum tastes best when it 's still relatively fresh and you can still taste the cane .	0

Any takers ? A side note : I 'm actually very serious about doing this , so if you 'd like to go speak up .	0
And if you 're going to flake out on me , don't.Also , every time I listen to this song , I shit myself a little in sheer amazment .	0
But I ca n't figure out why there 's no MF Doom vs. Dr. Doom .	0
MF Doom is the best rapper there is , pretty much .	1
I 'm not sure about best , I always loathe to declare anyone the ibest/i , but he sure as hell is up there .	0
I ca n't think of anyone else who is as consistently impressive as he - and I listen to a LOT of rap .	0
Dude , I 'm up for traveling .	0
But I do n't drive .	0

Also , if you could find someone who could drive interested in going that 'd be great , because I sure as fuck do n't want to do all the driving .	0

i had problems with cunningham last year .	0
shadia had problems with her before me .	0
and emily tracy before both of us .	0
cunninghams just fucking weird .	0
ok , so it 's not just me .	0
thanks for the reassurance .	0
i think i 'm starting to get on her good side though.i 'm just worried because english is what i want to major in in college , and if i get shitty grades this year , it could jeopardize my chances of going to the college i want to go to and everything else .	0
and , if i have to take AP english with her as a senior , i 'm double screwed because that 's a college course ... ... ..aargh .	0
thanks for listening to the random rant .	0
i believe i 'm beginning to babble now , so i 'll leave you alone ; P	0
nope , its not just you .	0
cunningham has her ups and downs , i 'm sure she 'll come to realize your a good student .	0
she did with shadia and me .	0
and she probably wouldve with emily had emily liked teela .	0
=P i 'm sure youll turn out fine , just dont stress about cunninghams craziness .	0
shes pretty old and senile .	0
=P and no problem for listening , bud .	0
Its unbelievable that CBS Morning News runs two stories , back to back , in which first they say that the corporate bonus is a great and progressive idea ( for a software company ) and then denounce the bonus as an example of capitalism out of control ( when done by a bank ) .	0
As I write software in a bank , I am doubly confused .	1
Maybe I 'll split this year 's into good and evil pots .	0
I was hired at my current position with a software start-up for 30 % less than I was making at another start-up 5 years ago .	0
It 's the economy , everybody has to make temporary sacrifices , blah-blah-blah.When I was hired the IT team was four-strong .	0
Two of those folks have since been canned .	0
My remaining support staff is not productive.Recognizing my frustration , I was offered a salary and bonus increase , but mentioned no numbers .	0
They do n't want me to leave .	0
They also asked me to take my CV off of Monster , etc .	0
I said no.Finally got the official notice of compensation adjustment : A one-time bonus of roughly 3 % of my base salary.This was supposed to convince me that the company loves me and persuade me reel in my tackle ?	0
I find it quite believable .	0

Banks are supposed to speculate .	0
My whole life appears to revolve around getting up , going to job one , working , rushing off to job two , working , running to the gym , working out and sleeping .	0

iAnonymous commenting is turned ON ( it always is , but okay ) .	0
What I want you to do is a post a confession in a comment .	0
It can be about anything at all .	0
Even me , but post anonymously .	0
It can be a deep , dark confession , or something just completely random .	0
Has there ever been something you 've always wanted to tell me , or anyone else ?	0
Now is the time .	0
Post as often as you want , and I will most likely reply , so you may want to check back./i	0
Yeah , I realized mine were on and that I should turn them off a few comments in .	0
I 'm a Christian , but sometimes I fear that I put Anderson Cooper on a higher pedestal than Jesus .	0
I 've started attending catholic mass because it makes me feel closer to stephen colbert .	0
Hoses ( and stuff ) turn me on .	0
I once scraped all the icing off of a cake and then ate it all ... .I was a fat kid .	0
I 'm bisexual but have been too scared that I 'm either just confused or that people will judge me to tell virtually anyone .	0
I tried to convince my parents a few months that bisexuality is a real thing but have thusfar been unsuccessful ; discouraging me from revealing to them how I feel .	0
I 'm a little sad that I feel the need to make this annonymous , but I guess that 's the point I 'm at still.Basically , being raised super-Christian with a penchant for repression has fucked up my ability to express this pretty badly .	0
So there 's a deep confession , I guess .	0
Um ... you 're welcome ?	0
I ca n't seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community .	0
She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing .	0
Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her .	0
I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone .	0
What makes it even harder is the fact that she is admittedly open to both sexes , which makes things seem even more possible , but I do n't know how to reconcile my feelings for her .	0
I have been struggling with this for a really long while and she has expressed interest in meeting me as well .	0
I really , really want to meet her , but I am afraid because I do n't know what to expect , if anything.Thank you for the opportunity to get this off of my chest .	0
On LJ and on OSCLA , I am constantly afraid that no one will like me .	0
I 'm afraid of being uncool , so I try too hard by chatting up the things I think are cool about me .	0
I get too braggy , hoping that I 'll secure my place as someone cool ... hoping the cool kids will like me .	0
I end up treating this all like it is high school , but I have n't been in high school for a long time.In other news , I 'm afraid that I will never meet any of the TDS or TCR people I admire ... and if I do n't meet them , I will never be completely happy with my life .	0
I worry that I take all of this far too seriously .	0
Last time I did this meme on someones journal , LJ tagged my IP as spam .	0
It took weeks to get my IP removed.Still , I 'm commenting anonymously .	0
I guess I like to live dangerously .	1
When I first started watching The Colbert Report I was seriously depressed .	0
If he had n't made me laugh and given me something to look forward to , I would n't be here today .	0
I guess he saved my life in some odd way .	1
My life is still completely fucked up , but he makes it bearable .	0
If anything , that goes to show how little I have .	1
I hate these things , because I 'm always afraid I 'll see something I wo n't want to .	0
So I will never put this on my journal .	0
I spend too much time trying to figure out who everyone is .	0
My oldest sister and then a male cousin ( the same age as my brother ) molested me when I was very young .	0
No one in my family knows about this though they do know I was molested by people outside the family .	0
Moreso than the molestation , though , I hate the two of them for the distance that I keep with my family on the whole .	0
I 've always thought I would overcome the need to separate my family from my life but I 'm in my 20s and it still has n't happened .	0
I 'm one of the people who is kinda intimidated by you and your many storiesbutI 'm afraid to tell you that because it would come off as bitchyand maybe it still will.But there it is .	0
it does n't , and i appreciate that .	0
we talked about book ... i was on xanax and probably a dick with rambling..but can i add ya ?	0
books	0
i 'm afraid someone is going to reveal something terrible about me that only people i 've known for years know .	0
sadly i have friends that have the knowledge to ruin me , just talking about things i 've done/said .	0
Yet another reason why it 's awesome to not have friends .	0
Too bad it also totally blows .	0
Dittooooo .	0
You are still logging our IP addresses .	0

i 'm trying to figure out how to turn that off now .	0
if only i was n't technologically retarded .	0
I know the feeling .	0
i figured it out ! !	0
thanks to my awesome google-fu powers.but really , i suck at these things .	0
After letting the laptop cool down for several hours , I was finally able to get it to reboot long enough to hook up the external hard drive storage device and back up all my data and art files.I have also found that by running the kitchen ceiling fan at arctic blast settings , I can get anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours of function with no shutdowns.I freeze my ass off this way , but I can limp along a while longer before I need to replace my computer now.With all my files backed up off of the comp 's drive and a seperate home system I can use for email and the like , I am less concerned about riding the beast into the ground..Its a very old unit , and has been getting steadily less able to perform the functions I require of it- its long past time to replace it , and I have just had other priorities.-Badger-	0
I know how you feel ... I have a crappy HP with that built in fan killing program that pops on when you do n't renew the overpriced warranty ...	1
So I have one of those cooling mat things that circulates the air under the laptops vents and runs off the USB ... At one point I had no internal fan at all and the cooling mat still kept it running nicely until I found and eradicated the capitalistware that kept turning off the internal fan to try and make me buy a new laptop .	0
*chuckles* Though sometimes all ya got ta do is give it a good blast of canned air .	0
Hmm , I do n't suppose you would have a link to somewhere showing where this 'fan-killing ' program is ?	0
I have an old HP Pavillion dv8000 .	0
You ... should get a netbook .	0
It 'd be easy to get to cons , has a long battery life , and best of all , is n't expensive .	0
You could probably pay it off with the savings you get by not running the fan at those speeds all the time.Also , are you going to Anthrocon later this year ?	0
I 'm not making it out to FC , and it 'd be cool to hang out with you for a while .	0
Spent some of yesterday at the Hope Cemetary in Worcester .	0
It was a celebation for the Cemetary ( odd , ai n't it ?	0
) , and since John Gough is buried there , I went and did part of my presenatation at his graveside .	0
It was my first visit to his grave , and felt a bit eerie , since I feel such a stron connection to him to begin with .	1
This may sound odd , but I like cemetarys .	1
Its quiet , green , rich in history , and has a strong connection to the past .	0
Last night was first rehearsal for the new rpoduction , very promising .	0
Although teaching 14 kids under 12 the jazz square is a bit daunting !	0
I love cemetaries ... Sometimes , when I 'm having an especially bad day at work , I go walk in the one here in the Square , and look at all the stones and such , and it really helps to me .	1
Yes , i find them very focusing .	0
I 'm in love with cemetaries .	1
Ghosties and dead people give me the willies , so cemetaries drive me mad.I usually walk around and attempt to read all the names on the old gravestones .	0
Just walk , stone to stone , and read all those people 's names .	0
People sitting right there in the ground .	0
People I never knew.Oh lordy .	0
I love cemetaries .	0
I think I shall visit every cemetary iever/i .	0
if anyone is intrested in giving Bush the big fuck you this friday then check out this site a `` i am sure you know the lieing , drunk , mass murdering , dumbshit is visiting st. helena ... ... ...	0

I think it 's funny how I 've only had your LJ username thing for a little over a month and I 'm already number 11 on your comment list .	0

i just voted ... so thats what democracy looks like ... interesting ... .in the voting building the workers were saying that so far there was only a 31 % turn out across the sate since there are n't any hot button issues ... ..that is fucking disgusting .	0
fuck anyone that did n't go out to vote , unless you are a republican .	0
if you stayed home , and are a republican , then you did your state a favor by not voting ... .but to all the progressives or democrats that did n't vote shame on you ... ... we have an impotent democrats in positions of power .	1
the only way to bring in people that reflect solid liberal and progressive values ( aka decent people with hearts and intelligence ) is to vote them in on a local level .	0
how is that not a hot button issue ?	0
jesus christ !	0
you said exactly the first line when we left the voting room ... ur a loser	0
republicans have a right to vote too .	1
And just because they might be republican , does n't mean they are a bad person .	0
There is no wrong vote , there is choice .	0
That 's what voting 's about , and republicans are people with thoughts as well .	0
Just because they do n't agree with your thoughts does n't mean they are idiots .	0
clearly , republicans have the right to vote .	0
i never disputed that .	0
my subjective feeling is that a republican vote is harmful to this country .	0
this is n't about good or bad .	0
i do n't care who the person is , if they have republican beliefs ( such as unregulated corporations , independence at the expense of the community , free market capitalism ) and more specifically social conservative beliefs ( such as being opposed homosexual marriage and social programs and believing in a version of family values based on twisted theology ) then i believe their beliefs are selfish , ignorant , and exceedingly adverse .	0
i do n't think they are idiots because they do n't agree with me .	0
i think they are idiots because their premises alienate and destroy .	1
i really do n't care if you agree with me or not .	0
this LJ is a place for me to express my unbridled and extremely subjective thoughts and feelings .	0
however , i appreciate your feedback .	0
i hate trying to explain that sort of thing .	0
It 's like , people always take it as me saying i hate someone because they dont agree with me , but im not and yeah ... you get the rest ...	0

p Someone sent me a postcard last week that was unsigned .	0
It was postmarked Las Vegas , and had a picture of the Columbia River Gorge .	0
Could it have been someone on my LJ friends list ?	1
I 've rounded up the usual suspects and none of them will admit to having sent it .	0
'T was n't me , but I can send you a postcard from Goshen IN if you like : )	0
That was me , just before I left Las Vegas .	0
Did I really not sign it ?	0
I guess it was ithat/i kind of a weekend .	0
Aha !	0
Yes , it was completely anonymous .	0
Nice picture , though !	0
It has been a while , yes indeed .	0
I 'm not sure if anyone even checks my journal to see if I post anymore .	0
How curious tothinkthat nobody might .	0
How interminable are words if they reach nothing.I 've been losing time all over the place lately .	0
Instead of a symmetrical grid of days , calendars now seem like a hopscotch game in which everything is simultaneous .	0
There 's no way to land on 5 squares at once , and yethere I am at the end of another month another year without a leg to stand on .	0
My brain has been persnickety lately about what it chooses to accept as imperative .	0
I feel as though everyone around me is moving about four times faster than me ; it takes me so much longer to experience a moment than it used to .	0
I feel like my skin is thin paper origamied around my bones , crisp pulp bent into ancient patterns .	0
I am so new and know nothing .	0
I am the product of billions of old things I have never met .	0
I am long-stemmed and far from the soil.He saidandquot ; you said a system in collapse is a system moving forwardandquot ; and I am a system moving forward.Onward , then .	0
i still check on a regular basis .	0
not in a creepy facebook kinda way , i just watch my friends updates a lot.always remember ; We must go forward , not backward .	0
Sideways , not forward .	0
And always twirling , twirling , twirling towards freedom .	0
You are a riot .	0
: D I hope everything 's going fantastically for you !	0
If you were a secret superhero and you could choose your skin -- if it could be any material what would you choose and why ?	0
e.g .	0
scales , alloy , velvet , wire , silk , carapace , bark etc .	0
Hmmmm .	0
Probably leather .	1
It 's durable , and smells lovely , and is protective , and malleable .	0
I love the soft wrinkles leather gets after it 's been through a lot .	0
Sometimes I look forward to getting wrinkles -- if I 'm lucky enough to live long enough to get them ! -- they 're kind of beautiful .	1
Kind of a boring answer , I suppose .	0
How about you ?	0
Not boring at all -- wrinkles do not get enough appreciation .	1
Tattoos of age .	0
( Botox really freaks me out ) .	0
Hmm , I 've got nothin ' .	0
I like my human skin .	0
But , it 'd be cool if maybe my skin could change temperature according to my surroundings and if I could absorb people 's negative energies and maybe radiate groovy colours .	0
iHow interminable are words if they reach nothing./iThey do n't have to reach , as they are a reflection of yourself , they will always be in proximity to someone ( you ) .	1
I hope , for the love of all that is lovely that things are what you want them to be .	0
Best headline ever from the front page of today 's AJC : blockquoteDEATH STILL ARBITRARY/blockquote	0
img	0
That kinda reminds me of my favorite out of the local paper in my college town .	0
Which , is n't so much of a clever headline as a TERRIBLE placement mishap between two unrelated articles.a	0
Also , the story 's byline says Lebanon , which is additional hilarity until you realize why it probably says that , and Google says that yes , there is a city called Lebanon in Marion County , Kentucky , and then Wikipedia says Lebanon is also a breed of domestic pigeon , and then you are confused .	1

Hi , you do n't know me but I just googled your name to ask you a question about doing comics for the Daily Wildcat .	0
However , Adventure Time is infinitely cooler than our school paper , and I am super impressed to see that you , a student , are working on the show while studying in Tucson .	0
If you do n't mind me asking , how did you land a sweet gig like that ?	0
apply to the wildcat to do comics !	0
i am quitting after this semester !	0
I love adventure time and I am SO glad it got picked up !	0
Not half as excited it on cartoon network since we in Canada have to pay alot to get that channel , so instead I hope it gets leaked onto the interwebs or teletoon picks it up soon after ... I also wanted to say I enjoyed your work on the candykingdom !	0

DUDE , YOU HAVE FANS IN AUSTRALIA ! I found this guy doing a random google search for simt.com .	0
These paragraphs were taken from his myspace ( myspace.com/kapowmotherfuckers ) .In his about me : jesse perez , aka www.sugarinmytea.com which is no longer up has been one of my major influences over the past few years , the gritty truth that her pictures convey and the many ways she has experimented with her work , always intrigued me and i have been taking from her work to improve my own work.In his who i 'd like to meet : jesse perez-truly an inspiration , if anyone knows where her works are featured on the net now , it would be a wonderful help if you could tell me .	0
amazing gritty style and complete disregard to what other people think of it .	0
Oh , and in his heroes : my brother , nik , for introducing me to the work of jesse perez .	0
We killed Lich King .	0
This is all nice and stuff ... but ... Well I just asked myself , dou you still do art of some kind between all this WoW ?	0

I actually told my guild that I would be going down to a casual player after we killed LK .	1
I realized that I am devoting too much time to things that do n't matter .	0

*edit*I wonder if his death in WOW will become ... hmm.. part of the warcraft story.I really would have loved to kill that fucker of Arthas now the Lich King.span class='ljedittime'emEdited at 2010-03-11 02:42 am UTC/em/span	0
Oh , it is .	0
:3 But , according to the storyline in the expansion right now , there must be *a* lich king .	0
The undead would overrun Azeroth otherwise without a leader ! After you kill Arthas , there 's this long RP/cinematic where Bolvar Fordragon , whom Arthas had captured and tortured , took up the helm and sword and became the new Lich King so that Azeroth would n't go cablooey.It was a very epic and fun ending !	0
I wonder.. who is this bolvar fordragon ? a elf ?	0
human ? gnome ?	0
etc.. ?	0
A human paladin .	0
:3 He was one of the two who led the assault on the Wrath Gate ( Draenosh being the Horde rep ; he was turned into a death knight ) .	0
I wonder how long until the lich king devours Bolvar 's sanity just like Arthas lost his to frostbourne 's power to end becoming a death knight	0
Dunno !	0
We 'll certainly see .	0

I was reading your party invitation and just realized how close you live to me - we 're practically neighbors ! I 'm at 6th and Fraser	1
Thats true , nine blocks if I 'm correct ? Are you going to come ?	0
If you brought Nesta he would n't even have to dress up !	0
To properly celebrate this birthday , I need an eleventy-one year old hobbit to make me his heir and throw us a joint party under a big tree .	0
Then he needs to give me a Ring of Power for my birthday present .	0
That 's right , folks .	0
In hobbit terms I 'm just leaving the tweens .	0
( Tolkein had that word first before modern society snagged it .	0
) John 's taking me to the Pot of Fromageness tonight .	0

hehe : ) i like this picturewell done !	0
Oh geez , I love Jessi-doodles .	0
seriously .	0
i have n't done a whole lot of serious work lately , but i do a lot of really bizarre stuff like this because my mother asks me to do illustrations for school stuff ... COW PLOW !	0
meh !	0
the cow is so cute !	1
i like that he 's chewing on hay .	0
i would like to see you too.are you free sunday ?	0

a title= '' Photo Sharing '' width= '' 782 '' height= '' 1128 '' alt= '' copwork '' /	0
Oh yeah .	0
I remember this project .	0
I did the snow bridge .	0
I 'm glad you chose this one .	1
The clothing district was probably the most challenging out of all of them .	0
And yet , the one that seemed the most fun .	0
wow those fire escapes are great , I ca n't even imagine how long those took to draw .	1
The figures are pretty static , I think I would like to see them interact with this very rich environment more than they are .	1
also those arcs on the windows are a great oppurtunity to whip out the french curve to get consistantly smooth lines for those arcs .	0
I do n't know if you did this on purpose but you definetely followed frank miller 's `` draw 7 bricks and they will get the idea '' theory .	0
Keep up the great work man .	0
I believe you mean iWill Eisner's/i `` draw 7 bricks '' theory .	0
are n't they the same person ?	0
Nice architecture !	0
You need to push the fire escapes out a little more and your figures need a bit of work , but that 's better than I could do my freshman year.I recommend looking at Will Eisner 's New York stuff on how to draw street scenes , fire escapes , alleys , and so forth .	0
Well , this is my sophomore year ... .	0
Shit , I should 've known that !	0
God damn .	0
I 'm going to be a senior this fall .	0
*cry*	0
btw What class was this for ?	0
Drawing for Sequential with Tom Lyle .	0
I picked the clothing district ( ? )	0
in New York for the photo .	0
I was talking to Melanie about how yours and mine could almost be sequential .	0
I think this might be the first sequence of comic panels I 've ever finished that I was proud of .	0
Now that I 've scanned it , I think I want to go in and add more blacks so its more obviously night .	0
I was struggling with where to place them before to make it look good , but maybe just the sidewalk could be blacker ?	0
I dunno.Please comment !	0
I suck , but I still need someone to tell me why !	0
Do n't you want to be that person ?	0
I 've already lettered the next tier and decided to go use the smaller nib I have .	0
I think it looks a lot better , but we 'll see once I 've stepped away from it long enough to get a new perspective.I also think I 'm going to go back and add more spot blacks on the sidewalk ... part of my challenge to myself with this is to get better at spotting blacks ( I 'm terrible at it ) , so I 'm trying to suggest light and form as much with straight black and white as I can , at least at first .	0
However ... I reserve the right to go back and use your advice !	0
Should n't it be O'BRIAN 'S ? ! ? ! ? ! ...	0
Not if I named it after a friend ! Unless you 're making a reference that went over my head .	0
Nope , no reference.I guess my complaint , then , is that your friend 's ancestors could n't spell .	0
At least it 's not O'Bryan 's ...	0
Whatareyatalking about ? ?	0
Those panels look GREAT !	0
if it 's night then should n't there be light coming from the inside of the buildings ?	0
also things should definitely be darker and there should n't be so much detail in the street , if it 's dark out then you should n't be able to see all of the stuff you are drawing .	1
I think the first panel could be done more simplistically and effectively .	0
I think you need to just loosen up and go with more instinct , it really feels like you are second guessing yourself a lot in these panels .	1
Loosen up Matt I have faith in you !	0
Are the people 's cast shadows new ?	0
I do n't remember them before .	0
Anyway , they are looking a little weird to me , especially the guy who is lying down .	1
And I disagree with Sean that you need light coming from the windows , because if it is that late most lights would be turned off , and places like the bar would have really dingy lighting anyway .	1
Also , you are a cutie .	0
I would use the streetlights as a lightsource and maybe do some hatching or halftone to create a gray effect on the sidewalk ... and I think the lettering is a little too thick , other than that great start !	0

Ah , well , it was a strange and odd experiment , regardless XD	0
With every mistake learned from , I am theoretically one step closer to perfection : D ( At this rate I should be there in no time . )	0
OMG are you serious ?	0
If I want to read your tweets then I will go to Twitter .	0
Especially if majority of tweets are replies to others .	0
It was n't supposed to post replies to other people !	0
I should n't have set I to run while I was asleep.. I only wanted it to catalog things from other people that I 'd retweeted , but it looks like it does n't do that anyway , so this has been a failiure all around .	1
Please , please do n't do this ; ) Your LJ 's great , do n't mess it up with half-conversation fragments !	1
I thought I disabled posting replies !	0
And in retrospect , I think I 've learned a lesson about configuring something to run when you are n't around to proofread the result .	0
I 'm paranoid about that - I always have to look at the first produced result before trusting it to just run on its own : )	1
I generally proofread everything I do , so in retrospect I 'm not sure what I was thinking .	1
Needs some working out , like hiding @ replies .	0
I also think it might be possible to use lj-cut code to also hide it from people who are n't fans of seeing Tweets in your LJ .	0
See previous two replies ; P I thought I already shut down the @ replies ... and , seeing as how the entire reason I started this was to print my RTs in my email , and they apparently do n't show up , I 've disabled the whole thing .	0
